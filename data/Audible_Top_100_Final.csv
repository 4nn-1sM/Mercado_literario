The narrator speaks clearly and varies his voice and accent just enough to help you keep track of who is speaking. Although the book is on the long side, it kept my interest from beginning to end. I learned a lot and was entertained. I feel saddened by Horwitz’s death. If he were still alive I would write him a word of thanks.",,Great final story from a talented author,"""Tony Horwitz was at his best when he blended history and journalism to tell us of our country’s past and present. He excels at in his final journey: “Spying on the South,” which was published just weeks before his death. The book is a mix of history lesson and travelogue as Horwitz follows in the path of landscape architect Fredrick Law Olmsted’s journeys through antebellum south. Each chapter includes part of Olmsted’s trip followed by Horwitz’ 21st-century journalism. There are plenty of interesting characters he meets across the south, particularly in Texas, which accounts for the second half of the book. I am sad this is Horwitz’ final journey but think it was a fitting finale for the talented author. I thought the narrator did a great job of capturing Horwitz' personality during the first-person travelogue accounts.",7 people found this helpful,Lovely finale for intrepid journalist/historian,"All such works - retracing the steps of a traveler-journalist and, a decade after his long trek, celebrated landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, and trying to make sense of the people and places he encounters - result in long sequences of, essentially, anecdotes, from which the author/traveler/investigator seeks to draw larger generalizations. The story of Olmsted's mounting animosity toward slavery runs through Horwitz's narrative, as does the author's indefatigable curiosity about what makes things tick here? and who might I talk to that will help me understand? Horwitz's generous treatment of a region that, to many, has been on the wrong side of history since 1619, or 1787, makes familiar sense of the state's, cities, and towns he passes through: with some exceptions, conservative, individualistic, religious, tribal, history-minded. Mining Olmsted's trilogy that comprises his The Cotton Kingdom enables Horwitz to resurrect history that few nonspecialists who read this book will have known about - for example, the antebellum experience of German 1848ers in Texan exile - and will send readers running back to the original texts. Horwitz does an excellent job following up on such stories and, where possible, bringing them up to date. He's also strong on detailing the horrors of slavery and the wrongs of Jim Crow. He draws unsurprising conclusions about political tribalism that is nearly analogous to the great national divide in the run-up to civil war. He is, however, generous to a near fault in writing about people with whom he disagrees. Horwitz concludes his trip by spending two days in Olmsted's greatest and best known work, NYC's Central Park, a monument to the artist's thoughts on Democracy as well as our first park, to which the author adds a paean to beautiful open spaces and their place in our history. Tony Horwitz's untimely death, at age 60, in late May 2019, while touring this book, deprives us of an essential observer, commentator, and author.",5 people found this helpful,,,,,,,

I appreciated some of the interesting trivia/facts he included, along with his experience of getting outfitted for his trek (amusing and unfortunately all too true!). The escapades and quirkiness of his hiking partner Katz made the whole thing even more entertaining -having carried some poorly-planned loads myself, I can completely envision his unloading of vital supplies (i.e., food) without thought. I was only disappointed with two aspects. I did find Bryson to be sometimes over-critical and condescending toward various people, places and organizations he wrote of - which took away, rather than added to his adventure in my opinion. But I was even more disappointed when he revealed that he stopped his trek less than half-way, and then wrote about a series of fairly boring day-hikes on other sections of the trail. When he and Katz finally gave it up when they were barely into the 100-mile wilderness in ME, and before coming close to reaching Katadin, I was very let down. I had assumed he had written about a thru-hike, or at least a 2000-mile qualifier ... but this was not the case, and was a disappointing end to the tale.",2 people found this helpful,,,,,,,

It is narrated by Peter himself. Mayle’s year in the picturesque Luberon Valley is filled with language faux pas, cultural misunderstandings, and some missteps in their efforts to fit in, but all through the changing of the seasons, Mayle and his wife make good friends and become infused with the aroma and taste of French culture.

If he wanted to go to lunch today, I would certainly go with him. He's clearly smart, well read, funny in a sarcastic way. I'm pretty sure most people like him when they meet him. I related well to his temperature regulation. It's always a point of contention with my wife when I'm cold and she's hot. John and I agree on the thermostat. The book was not quite what I expected and was what I expected at the same time. I love Bigfoot so I am predisposed to be interested in, and to like new information about the undefeated hide and seek champion. This book is more about the hunt than about the creature. The descriptions of the hunts, the hunters and the like are entertaining and again, you would not be bored at a Bigfoot hunt. I was hoping for a little more discussion about any evidence and examples of found species, etc. That's my personal preference, so it's not really a criticism. Also, common sense tells you Bigfoot doesn't exist, so there's not a large amount of evidence. The bad part; this Bigfoot book is almost a diatribe against Republicans, Christians, conservatives in general, and Donald Trump. There is literally no place in this book's subject matter for Mr. O'Connor to rail against half of the US population and insult and demean the millions of Christians who exist and have existed. Mr. O'Connor is saying that he is far more intelligent and superior to all those millions and to half of the population of the United States. He doesn't care for Trump: he should write a book about Trump. He thinks Christians are stupid people: write a book about how miracles can't happen. (That's why it's called faith). He could be right, but how does that fit in a Bigfoot book? If you can find an edited version of the book written by this intolerant bigot, I would recommend it. It was fun.",5 people found this helpful,Interesting but perhaps not essential,"""Interesting look at Bigfoot myth making with good historical context and some tinges of Covid paranoia and political disinformation. These areas are fascinating in their ties to Bigfoot and I’d have liked even more discussion of the relationship. I do think there are some pacing issues—there’s a very long chapter that is essentially a birding trip that really slows down the narrative. I do get the parallel he is drawing between Bigfoot and the previously-assumed extinct bird, but portions of that chapter definitely drag. I don’t know that this book adds much if you already have done some reading into the larger bigfoot culture. The author’s recounting of primary research in the field is interesting and fun to hear about though.

The story isn't just that of Livingston: it is the story of Livingston, all he embodies, and all those whose life he touched whether directly a friend of his, or inspired by his life's work. if you're expecting this to be a straight Livingston biography, you will be surprised because the book equally focuses on Livingston and Stanley, The New York Herald journalist who traipsed through Africa to find the missing explorer. Both men are equally interesting, as are the peripheral characters who both fund their exploitives and either aid or harang the heroes. Far from boring, this book reads like a travel narrative. It is filled with interesting perspectives on African culture from the perspective of Livingston, Stanley, and others. Exciting stories of lions, crocodiles, political intrigue with African chieftains, Arab slaver traders and all the good and bad they had to offer... and that only covers the African stories. Stanley's backstory and personal journey are equally interesting as the missing great explorer. What I enjoyed best was the way the author has taken very complicated men, and using quotes from their own writings, is able to delve into their mindsets, motives, and emotions. There is no simplifying, they are men who are clearly at odds with themselves as they seek greatness through hard work, perseverance, and redemption.",,Much to think about,"This is the rousing adventure tale that it purports to be; made all the more fascinating because it is a (mostly!) accurate depiction of historical events. If you are hoping to be transported to another place and time, the book delivers. Perhaps of even greater interest is the flawed humanity of the two main characters, Stanley & Livingstone. Their stories offer many layers of lessons and warnings about good intentions, unintended consequences and the baffling mix of good and evil that features so prominently in the human condition, leaving the reader with much to think about. Congratulations to author Martin Dugard!",,,,,,,,

He tends to draws parallels between his own experience climbing K2 and the expeditions of the past.

Listened to the prologue and actually gasped, then laughed, then listened with mounting interest. I bought the book. This is not a book about the Pacific Crest Trail and it is. I know, sounds crazy doesn't it? The PCT is the main thread, it gives the story continuity and a goal. The real story is how and why Cheryl Strayed happens to be on (or strayed onto) the trail. She takes us on her life's journey, along many of the lows, a few of the highs and shows us what lessons she took away from them. In the telling CS is absolutely frank and honest. She tells us things most of us probably wouldn't tell our mothers, perhaps not even our best friends and certainly not total strangers. But it makes the telling even better. And she tells the story well! CS has a smooth writing and storytelling style, that drew me in. At times I found myself laughing out loud, while at others I was moved to tears and at all times I wanted to know what would be/happen next! Bernadette Dunne does an excellent job. The narrator can add something to a book or absolutely destroy it. I've put probably perfectly good books away, because the narrator annoyed me so much I couldn't go on listening to him/her. Not BD though, she adds to the story!! At no point does she become irritating, annoying or worse. Her pleasant voice and style make reading this book an even better experience. Sometimes the language is explicit (i.e. when CS writes about a sexual fantasy or her experiences with drugs), but never abusive, always functional and always with a lesson to be learned. Not forced upon us, but the attentive reader can pick it up easily. Like I said before: the book is not about the »PCT« and it is. The part that is, tells us how best to prepare for a long distance hike .... or not ;-). The hiker in me gasped at her description of her first packing of her backpack, then laughed out loud when the image of her lifting it was conjured up in my head, suffered with her when she talks about her hiking boots and was not a little jealous when thinking about making a similar trip myself. »Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail« is totally enjoyable. No lessons need to be learned if you don't want to. You can just enjoy a good reading/listening experience. Your money would not be wasted. However, all of us can take something away from this book and take a fresh look at our own lives to see where own particular »PCT« might lead. Then your money definitely won't be wasted. So, to everyone - hiker and non-hiker alike - I say: buy this book!!",67 people found this helpful,"Oh, so close . . .","""This book had so much potential and, indeed, portions of it were very good. It is an autobiography of the author, Cheryl Strayed. At age 45, she decides to hike the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) as an escape and a way to find herself after her mother dies, and she divorces her husband. She has various affairs and gets hooked on drugs (heroin). Her life is a mess and the hike is a way to start anew. I am a hiker, and I really enjoyed the narrative when she is hiking. The story goes back to her mother, her married life (which wasn???t bad), and her affairs throughout the story. I wasn???t a fan of the regular use of the language throughout the book and her graphic verbiage used to describe the ???sex??? she had with others. She F*@% him, and F*@% him, and F*@% him. You get the drift. I get she had affairs, but why the strong language? Why do you have to tell us you haven???t even masturbated once during your hike? Who cares! You can get the same point across without all the hyperbole. I just about bailed on the book a few times. As I kept reading, I was captivated by how the journey was making her stronger and really molding her as a new person. She was a novice hiker and packed her pack too heavy and could barely hike a few miles in a day in the beginning, and eventually going 20 miles in a day. She lost half of her toenails and strengthened her body. There was enough story there to balance out the other crap. I was waiting for the finish, thinking it really made a difference of who she had become. It ended with a fizzle. No really strong revelations. No big ah-ha moment. No lesson learned.

Needless to say it was very challenging to listen to. There are a lot of characters in this book and the narrator reads all the characters in unique made-up voices, some really tough to stomach. i thought the main of this book was poor. The preachy, know it all ways of Sid, the older gentleman grew tiresome as the chapters progressed. The overall story was different from other back country books I've read; this was more focused on telling a story with a plot than simply logging miles and states of mind.

Listening to this, it makes me want to step out of my comfort zone and book the dang trip. Naysayers, be damned! Kacie speaks with bold honesty and brave openness about her specific journey, all the ups and downs. Maybe I’m taking it out of context, as I am a product of a proud military, “USA” family, however a few parts about explaining to Europeans the “pledge of allegiance”, “living to work, not working to live” and some, if not most, Americans don’t travel locally or globally caught me off guard. I don’t know if some Americans choose to live quite happy lives living in their rural towns or not traveling globally even if they could. Let me be clear—By no means was Kacie at all judging others or bashing her home country. She was just speaking her mind unapologetically & I love she finally (as you will hear) felt free to do so. Simply stated, listening to her book, it’s clear she loves many things about Italy far better than she does about the US (healthcare, slower pace) and that’s fantastic.

If I skip a day I go back and listen to the prior lesson again on a fasted speed and see if I can keep up. If not, I repeat the lesson at the normal pattern and continue on. Sometimes I just repeat the lessons to get a better grasp. I like that they weave in prior learning to current lessons so as to keep reminding you along the way. That along with the vocabulary seems to be doing the job. After the next few chapters, found in another audiobook in the series, I’ll see if I feel confident enough to try with my Spanish speaking friends.

The world-building and plot were very intriguing; that's the reason I wanted to read these books. If I wanted insecure relationship drama, I'd read a book about that. I wanted to read a series about cool magical (but not really) powers and saving the world. That's what I signed up for. The ending was satisfactory but too cliche for me. And there was STILL a ton of Mal and Alina being unbearably whiny and insecure about their relationship until like that last 20 pages. This one wasn't anywhere near as bad as the second book in that respect, but it was still annoying. Bardugo does a good job of developing secondary characters, and a terrible job of using them. This has happened throughout all three of the book: I get attached to the characters because they're interesting, and then they just more-or-less don't really do anything to affect the plot. I liked the twist with the third amplifier, although I wish Mal had stayed dead because that would have been more interesting and less Disney fairy tale.",2 people found this helpful,Brace Yourself- I couldn't stop listening!,"""This series was amazing.

In the Maze Runner and the Scorch Trials, Thomas and Theresa kept saying they were responsible for everything. In both books, people forgot things and saw things. There were a lot of impossibilities thrown at us that were never really explained. The kids were constantly running for their lives and the whole time met betrayal after betrayal. I know they were being tested for something. And obviously there will be a book three. But I kind of wish they would have thrown us a bone in book 2. At the end of this one, I found myself thinking, Oh not again! Also, I thought the two girls (Theresa and Brenda) were pretty creepy. I don't know if it was the story or the narrator (he was great, but did a creepy girl's voice), but I didn't like or trust either of them.

I looked forward to the movie that was coming out. Then I listened this one. I thought Aaron did well stepping into the voice of Four and I did all right with the perspective jumping back and forth. But then we got to the.... I guess I'll call it the Big Plot Twist. I get that Roth wanted to be different and not follow convention, but I actually had to go back and listen to the Big Plot Twist again because I just couldn't believe that it was what it was. It soured the whole story for me, and I actually tend to like this sort of plot twists in many of my other books, but NOT in a YA fantasy and NOT from a first person narrator. I feel it violates actual writing convention and storytelling and immediately throws your reader out of the story. Honestly, I can only think that the producers of the movie Divergent found out about the Big Plot Twist and said, Oh crap, there goes the franchise... I might give Roth another try in the future, but I would certainly be a lot less trusting of her narrators....",8 people found this helpful,I loved this series!,"""I loved and hated this book! it was a great read.

At the conclusion of Insurgent many of my original questions, from the first book were answered, but created even more questions to be answered by the third.

The protagonist, Tris, like Katniss, is trying to understand herself in the context of a revolution, blossoming love, and personal loss. Having been raised in a sub-community of selfless people, her deeply rooted compassion softens her otherwise tough and daring persona, and I find her a completely believable and engaging narrator. I'm sure some of this is owing to the excellent reading by Emma Galvin. In this part of the story, readers get many answers to teasers and mysteries suggested since the first book and developed to a greater level of complexity in this book, but the new questions will whet their appetites for what's coming next. This is really impressive storytelling by a new young author, and her fully-imagined social hierarchy is thought-provoking.",2 people found this helpful,,,,,,,

Number 1 This book in the start is really repetitive don't get me wrong I love this book it's like you are living in the book it gives a sort of immersion, how you ask by stocking the shelves of your store,doodling in your journal, growing your garden, Fighting dungeons, finding more humans, Training, this book is like you are the person at least for the first couple hours then the action starts. Also I don't like how this book has so much dialog I know I just wrote a paragraph on how good it was but there was alot of useless stuff in this book don't get me wrong this author has remarkable writing skills all I got to say is DO NOT BINGE this Is a book you listen to a hour or two a day I got this book when it came out and chain listened 16 hours until it got boring if you do get into the 4 hour mark and think it's getting boring just wait. this book is also so dramatic I couldn't find a better word to describe it the Mc gets depressed then happy then gets sad for killing someone goes on a 10 minute rant on how it's his responsibility or something like that. it might seem that I'm making the book seem bad but I like it I just want people to get this book and know what they are getting this review is detailed and hopefully someone gets it.",8 people found this helpful,A great addition to the genre with a few glaring exceptions.,"""I will say that I was hesitant to pick this one up. I was worried that a “card” based system of magic and combat would manifest as hours of ill-advised, frustration inducing, turn-based, fight scenes. However, I was pleasantly surprised with a really well rounded and evolved magic system that has real depth. This book is mostly well written and Travis Baldree’s performance is every bit as good as it always is. The reason I can only say that the book is mostly well written is that in general it’s actually really well written, until he decides to make a pivotal shift in the plot. Almost every single time, he does this via a drawn out fight scene in which the MC suddenly turns into the oblivious cheerleader in a 70’s, B Horror movie. Invariably, the MC starts doing totally irrational things with no explanation from the author that just happen to draw the fight scene out. Most notably he often completely forgets about one or more of his core abilities that could have ended the fight in ten seconds. Sometimes the author acknowledges this but doesn’t adequately explain why the MC would be so unbelievably stupid. More often it’s never explained at all. This had the affect of me rolling my eyes and yelling at the audiobook in much the same way that we used to yell at the blond cheerleader not to go into the unlit basement to have casual sex while a serial killer is loose in the neighborhood. It’s especially annoying because the rest of the book is so enjoyable. This is either a major fail on the part of the editor and beta readers or on the part of the author for not listening to his editors and beta readers. Because the problem is glaringly obvious, and it happens repeatedly throughout the book. In the end this didn’t ruin the book for me, and I do recommend that it’s worth your credit. However I hope that Mr Mathews doesn’t continue to use this cheap plot device in future works. It’s not only beneath him, it’s beneath any reasonably intelligent person, and it’s just lazy.",2 people found this helpful,Great Momentum,The book just kept getting better as it went.

He writes about OCD like he’s living it, but that doesn’t negate the fact that it is exhausting to listen to. Aza’s disease makes you want to reach through the book and shake her. Her obsessive thoughts and irrational thinking is obnoxious. You sympathize with her but you hate her. And the worst part is she’s not the only one you hate! I’m glad that John green has passed on the character of ‘manic pixie dream girl’ to a side character, this time by way of Aza’s best friend, daisy. It’s easier to see how annoying this trait is now that we’re viewing it through the eyes of a 17 year old male obsessed with her, and why it just needs to stop. And lastly, we have Davis. The son of a youth obsessed billionaire who left all of his fortune to a lizard. Davis is quiet and unobtrusive but parts of him scream ‘r/im14andthisisdeep’. He’s a poet and a star gazer and otherwise a lot like toast. Bland and brittle. The characters I’d like to have seen more of- Michael with his surprisingly thoughtful art project, or Noah and his attempt to process his father leaving him at the age of 13- those characters were side notes.

I must be honest that while I was reaching the end of the book I was pacing like a caged animal. The stress, the pressure, the crumbling of events were too charged with anxiety. The Toll is all I was expecting from these finaly. We start with a boom and we end it with a boom. It was quite a struggle and I felt so much annoyance and almost hate towards one character. It is incredible and sad how the human species will corrupt anything they have access to, power is corruption and corrupts everything, and at the end everything fell under its own weight. I knew by the 38% of the book how it was going to end and I even post it on a group discussion here to leave records that I knew, and I read sceptical about it, and I was going to be so disappointed if I was going to he right.

He is one of many that received their power from a star called Calamity that appeared in the sky one day. Most thought the people that received these new found powers would use them for the benefit of mankind; wrong. With ultimate power comes ultimate corruption. Steelheart has the strength of 10 men. He’s virtually indestructible, he can fly and when he’s enraged he can turn inanimate objects into steel. He exercised that particular power to transform most of Chicago and part of Lake Michigan before becoming the emperor of “Newcago.” David Charleston was an eight year old boy when he saw Steelheart murder his father. Ten years has passed and David can think of only one thing; bringing Steelheart down. He is just a normal human and decides to recruit another group of humans, called “Reckoners” to help him. Reckoners study those like Steelheart, to learn their weaknesses. This is a story that has been told many times, the struggle between good and evil, but this time Superman is not on our side; can good still win? Its billed as a Y.A. book, and there is some romance that is usually associated with such genre, it does not, however, overwhelms the story; anyone that like Sci-Fi adventure should like this book. It is, after all, by Brandon Sanderson; and, by all indications it is the start of an epic tale.",394 people found this helpful,X-Men Except Better -- Get in on the ground floor,"""Steelheart is a story of special powers and set in a gritty city. The story is told from a first person point of view. The story opens with our hero traumatized. We are barely into the second chapter when Sanderson lays out the plot and titillates us with added complex characters. One interesting aspect is how the seedy aspect of the city is woven into the telling-- it is a much more believable takeoff of X-Men. Macleod Andrews does a great job narrating and I hope he continues with the series. Based on the assumption that this book one in a series, I think it has lots of legs and interesting plotlines to explore. I listened to the six chapter release on audible before and was intrigued. Given the amount of publicity Audible has been given it, I had high expectations -- and it delivered. This novel should appeal to listeners of all ages. Get in on the ground floor of this series.

This is not a spoiler, but early on the protagonist says her father shot her and left her bleeding when he abandoned the family. While meant figuratively, I thought for a second it was literal, and was entranced that the story might be a journey to learn why he shot his daughter. It might have been more interesting. Would you recommend We Were Liars to your friends? Why or why not? The book is very well written, and has well defined, fully realized characters. Having said that, this is a dark book without any particular depth or meaning, although the events and extreme emotionality almost simulate them. The younger the reader is, the more they may be hoodwinked, although I wouldn't recommended the book to anyone under 15. It touches on racism, elitisms, hypocrisy, friendship, family, charity, nostalgia, and fleetingly with forgiveness, but not to any true sense of resolution. Some have commented on the twist(s) or the predictability, and I have to admit that if you combine two very popular movies together you've locked in on this books key gimmicks. I have mixed emotions, because they were undeniably well executed. Memory repression & selective amnesia have been somewhat of a cliche over the past 30-years and I wonder if they happen much more in movies and books than in real life. The chief mistake of the book is that the reveal is so close to the end that there is only time for minimal resolution. There is not a compelling message or resonance to the book. Perhaps young people are idealistic and sometimes very foolish and old people are sometimes controlling and as childish as young people, but why did the author think this particular story was important to tell? What could have been a mystery, a horror novel, or a coming of age story gets somehow stalled as a character development piece. Ultimately the book reads quickly and maintains interest, so I don't discourage reading it--just know that it is more or a tragedy than an HEA. Two examples (not YA) of books that are fully fleshed out, but better developed tragedies with some similarity to this book are: The Mystic Arts of Erasing All Signs of Death & An Arsonist's Guide to Writers' Homes in New England Which character – as performed by Ariadne Meyers – was your favorite?

And it could, in some future world, be a realistic plot. Ryan Schow's writing style is easy to read, clear, crisp and well composed. Most characters could be realistic, albeit a bit simplistic. But there is no way on God's green earth that these characters could possibly survive 90% of the physical and situational abuse, damage and torture that several of them are subjected to over and over and over again. Not to mention the battles that they fought with 1 against 100's, and still succeed. Still, the writing is sufficient to carry these supernatural characters through the book as long as the reader sets aside a big chunk of reality. It's also much assisted by Kevin Pierce's wonderful narration. I read all 5 books. Not sure I will attempt any more of this author's books, though. It requires so much work to stretch my imagination to accept what is happening, that I find myself balking frequently and needing to talk myself into accepting this as reality.

It was worth every minute of the listening, and my 16 and 18 year-old boys were just as drawn into it as I was. I immediately shed my suspicions about any audiobook that is read by the author after only a few minutes of McCullough's narration. Not a lot of variation, but clear, warm and intimate. But it was his story that kept me listening. History is the recollection of people, events and ideas that shape nations and cultures, but too often historians reduce the telling of history to a recitation of facts and details. Not this historian. For McCullough, details are the servants of the real stories of Washington, Howe, Clinton and all the others whose lives intersected in the events of 1776 to promote an idea that would literally change the world for centuries to come. I was drawn in and drawn along in the drama of the American fight for independence, constantly reminding myself that, yes, we did win, when it seemed impossible that we ever could have. I have studied American history, but I was confronted in this book with just how remarkable the revolution really was, and how unlikely its promise of success. This book gave me new respect for the founders of our great country, and strengthened my resolve to never take my freedom lightly or forget the sacrifices that secured it.

While those books are very high on my TBR list, I've never read any of them, and I still THOROUGHLY enjoyed this whimsical, imaginative fantasy! Let me also say that I am not a huge fantasy reader. In fact, I can probably count on one hand the number of fantasy books I've read and with that said, Once Upon a Broken Heart was a surprise to me. I loved the characters and the fascinating world that Stephanie Garber created. The narrator Rebecca Soler is a favorite of mine, and she was the perfect voice for the protagonist Evangeline Fox. Luc is the love of Evangeline's life and he suddenly leaves her to marry her stepsister Marisol. Evangeline, desperate to get Luc back, enters into a deal with Jacks, the Prince of Hearts. I immediately connected with Jacks, and would love to read more about him or hear from his point of view! If there could ever be a bad boy in a fantasy, Jacks would certainly be it. I do love an anti-hero! Evangeline doesn't fully comprehend the deal she makes even though as a reader, I knew it probably would not turn out well for her. Lots of adventures ensue on Evangeline's path to a happy ending. She is a strong, feisty heroine and I could not wait to see what the author had in store for her next. There are lots of interesting characters, and none of them are really who they appear to be. I understand that Jacks is a character from the Caraval series and just for him, I would read those books. He's smart, funny, mysterious and possibly wicked? But in all fairness, Evangeline knew he was one of the Fates and that making a deal with him was filled with danger. I really wanted to see if he and Evangeline would end up together since they had amazing chemistry together. There is a but of a cliffhanger but I can't wait to see what the author has planned for Jacks and Little Fox. This book has an almost fairy-tale like quality to it that I loved. It can absolutely be read as a standalone and if you are an audiobook lover, then I highly recommend listening to this as narrated by Rebecca Soler.",,just as good as the Caraval series,"""I was completely on edge during this whole book.

I literally didn't put it down for 2 days. The best thing that I can suggest to you is to read this book with an open mind and to not even base it off of the movie. To start off, some of the book had me captivated just because I wanted to see what happened next each time. There was absolutely no back story to the characters because the characters had none to give. The memories were gone and they didn't know anything about themselves; so as you read the book, you are learning who they are with the characters. Never read a story that was written in this style but found it captivating, as if I was in the Glade with them. The ending was absolutely awful because of tying the loose ends together it just started to fray. No questions were answered but 100 more arise just by the last 3 chapters. So many people gave this book an absolutely awful review on Goodreads which almost made me not want to read the book but I am glad I didn't listen to them. They were far to harsh about the book and style of writing. The best way to describe this book was an Intentional Modern Lord of the Flies.",1 person found this helpful,,,,,,,

I really enjoy fantasy and haven’t had a chance to read any Young Adult fantasy in a while so when I kept hearing great things about Shadow and Bone, I had high hopes. And thankfully they were met, albeit some issues. So, we’ve got Alina, just your regular orphan girl who is secretly in love with her best friend who doesn’t seem to be interested and is off running around with other girls. But then, she’s got a secret power! The thing about Alina is that I do like her but she doesn’t seem overly special or unique to me in any way other than her power. I wanted more personality from her – more spark. But I’m willing to wait for character development to occur in the next two books. Then there’s the Darkling – alluring, provocative, sexy, tempting. He’s creepy, but I like it. He’s powerful and dark and I can’t help but kind of sucked in by his magnetic pull. And while this story is about Alina finding her power, it’s definitely a plot-driven book. Though I won’t go into what that specific plot is, since I don’t want to ruin anything for those who haven’t read the book. But it’s fast paced and I could not put it down – I would say I was flipping through the pages but I listened to the audiobook so there weren’t actually pages. And by the way, the voice actor was great. Her voice for the Darkling was sultry and I loved it! Fans of Graceling by Kristin Cashore should pick this one up – it’s got good, evil, romance, love, and action.",16 people found this helpful,I love this book,,3 people found this helpful,,,,,,,

The first half of the book is character driven and how non military Germans lived during the war. Even though they were surrounded by strife and hunger, this story showes that even in the throes of war it is still possible to forge very special relationships through love and kindness. The second half is more about the war and how so many people were terribly affected by such a gruesome regimen, and having to live everyday with the fear of being bombed. I normally steer clear of books about this horrible atrocity, however, I was convinced by so many wonderful reviews that I had to give it a chance.

I mean, I usually am not when a series I love ends, but this was different. Also the reader didn't do as great of a job with this book as she did the others.

The ending felt a little obvious and the 'hook' for the 'twist' at the end comes during this book, making it feel rushed and not as well planned. The jump in the main relationship feels a little unnatural as far as hate-turns-to-love type stories. The performance is solid with reasonably well-defined voices, though the narrator sometimes relies more on cadence than tone to differentiate characters (A military officer partway through the book who only has a handful of dialogue sounds the same as The Roach, but in a different rhythm, which can be jarring/illusion breaking). As with previous books, I noticed the audio at times seems to swap in quality, making the narrator sound much closer or a bit farther at times. Sometimes short phrases sound very 'cut in' and not as if the book is being read in a sitting, but that a phrase was forgotten and had to be edited back in. It is minor but if you listen on headphones, it's very noticeable. Worth the dive into the series, you will definitely like it if you've enjoyed Holly Black's other titles.",1 person found this helpful,Satisfying ending to a guilty pleassure trilogy,"4,5?

I can see why there are so many positive reviews for this book because it was done exceptionally well if you’re into this genre. This book is simply a darker version of “The Hunger Games” if you ask me with a stronger female lead. The similarities between this book and “The Hunger Games” are startling I must say. The narrator did justice to the title itself and coupled with the story had you gripping the edge. There are some parts of this book that literally gets your mouth to drop and your eyes to widen. Also, when the action picks up, the action really picks up and the author creates such interesting imageries that left me quite impressed. This is just a fun listen if you ask me, with the right combination of poignant moments and fun, light moments. If you enjoyed The Hunger Games or books within that genre you will simply love this book... if you didn't enjoy The Hunger Games though, I suggest you pass on this on. OF NOTE: I listened to this book just AFTER I listened to “Einstein’s Relativity” (which I thought was just plain painful to listen to) so my review might be a bit skewered (positively) because the thought of that other book is fresh in my mind….",78 people found this helpful,"Insane No, Dauntless Yes","""HASTE WILL NOT HELP I don't need to review this as so many already have, but for those who care what I think, this is a very good book. It of course is a teen book and it reads like one. As a 54 year old man I liked it, but believe teens would like it even more. Unlike some authors who believe writing for a younger audience means writing with less skill, Roth writes a very intelligent novel. I liked Ness's Chaos series better and Hunger Games a little better, but this is still a five star read. I liked the main character a lot. She is not a beautiful girl, but she does not sit around and cry about it. In most situations, she may doubt herself at first, but she most always, gets her sh#t together and faces down the fear. In this way it is an upbeat story. I believe it teaches teens and even us old people, that you have to face your fears, it is not one of those good things happen to those who wait for it to happen. This is one of the most important lessons, especially for our young, in my opinion. The books is predictable in spots, but there is plenty that happens that I did not see coming, especially toward the end. There is also stuff here on brainwashing, another important subject. POLITENESS IS DECEPTION IN PRETTY PACKAGING The only thing that bothered me a little and only a little, was the premiss that a population would purposely divide into factions. They claim they did it to help prevent war. I believe that most intelligent people would do exactly the opposite. Dividing into factions would naturally lead to war. That aside this is a really good book and I am looking forward to reading the sequels.",28 people found this helpful,"Interesting, but not excellent","If you've already listened to the Hunger Games trilogy, then you should be warned that this book, while similar in concept, is not as good.

I also do not care for the changes he makes to his voice to signify different characters who are speaking especially his feeble attempt at doing a female dragon voice. Truthfully, it makes the book difficult to listen to especially after having seen the movie which, no doubt, has placed an indelible idea as to who the characters are from the story into my mind.

The narration also gets way better once there is more action. Not sure what so many reviewers are complaining about.

This is the origin story we all needed… 1) Snow is instrumental in the development and evolution of the Hunger Games as we know them. 2) Snow's absolute resolve to a path of power and his lack of empathy are compelling. The bit where he considers Sejanus's ma's cookies. (jaw on floor) I found the evolution of the games to be fascinating. The way the tributes used to be treated vs the spectacle and opulence we see in the original trilogy. The introduction of sponsors and how the designation of mentors to the tributes evolved. We are introduced to one of the most horrifically cruel game makers in the history of the games. ???????? ? ???????? There is a point to everything or nothing at all, depending on your worldview. -Dr. Volumnia Gaul “What happened in the arena? That's humanity undressed. The tributes. And you, too. How quickly civilization disappears. All your fine manners, education, family background, everything you pride yourself on, stripped away in the blink of an eye, revealing everything you actually are. A boy with a club who beats another boy to death. That's mankind in its natural state.” -Dr. Volumnia Gaul ???????? ? ???????? Sejanus is our moral compass and has some of my favorite lines in the book! ???????? ? ???????? “You've no right to starve people, to punish them for no reason. No right to take away their life and freedom. Those are things everyone is born with, and they're not yours for the taking. Winning a war doesn't give you that right. Having more weapons doesn't give you that right. Being from the Capitol doesn't give you that right. Nothing does.” -Sejanus Plinth ???????? ? ???????? Overall, this was a treat and a very satisfying beginning to the world of Panem. **TO SUZANNE COLLINS** Thank you for this rich history in Panem. Please write a series about all of the victors. I would love a book dedicated to Finnick. The way he deals in secrets. What all those secrets must be. What life in the capitol must have been like for him. This line of thought only makes me curious about all of the victors of the Hunger Games. “The Winner's Circle” ?? potential title? ??",5 people found this helpful,why is everyone hating on the narrator???,"I was nervous to purchase this based on the reviews that the narrator was monotone and uninterested, that he didn't do character voices etc. All completely false! I just finished the book and the only thing I think he could have changed would be to actually attempt the singing. Or they should have hired a singing narrator, being that this story is so music heavy. As far as the cadence, I feel like Fontana really captured a teenage Snow. Nearly mirroring the speech patterns of the actor who plays him in the movie. Of course he's going to sound bored, he's a narcissistic psychopath. The only person he finds interesting is himself.

I highly recommend this book. This book is full of adventure. Aelin may sound so full of herself; but she is full of love for the people and causes that she loves. Rowan, Doran, Manon, Aedion and Lorcan are also great characters. I like the way we were able to her different characters POV. I don't think this book is appropriate for kids as young as 11-13.

Also, there's a good bit of Grimdark about this, with everyone doing or having done awful things, and mostly willing to do more awful things. And at the end, we have a resolution to the story within this book, but no resolution of the larger issues, and much more bad stuff to come in future volumes. So, really, at some point, I should have been overcome with the desire to throw it against the wall, except for two things. One, it's the audiobook. Two, I loved it. Aelin Galathynius (guessing on the spelling of the last name), rightful heir to the throne of Terrasen (another spelling guess) has quietly returned to Rifthold, the capital of the bitter enemy who killed her family and conquered her kingdom. She wants revenge on the King of Adarlan, but he's not the only target of her vengeance. She was hardly more than a child when she fled her family's killers, and she's just nineteen now, but she's packed a lot into those years. She trained as an assassin under Rifthold's king of the assassin's guild, under the name Celaena Sardothien. Part Fae herself and possessing Fae fire magic, she traveled to the Fae lands and learned the use of her magic there--and made a valuable friend in Prince Rowan. She's back now to rescue her friend and cousin General Aedion and her friend Prince Dorian. She needs to know if Chaol Westphal, captain of the guard, is still a friend. She's been through horrors, she has done horros, and she has more to face and do before she can hope for anything vaguely resembling peace. This is a dark and bloody story, but I like Aelin, Rowan, Aedion, Chaol and his second, Nesryn, and Aelin's old rival Lysandra. Along with the darkness and blood, Queen of Shadows has romance, male friendship, female friendship, and male-female friendship, all treated in adult, satisfying, compelling way. Because, as I mentioned, I've read none of the previous three books, there's a lot I was trying to pick up as the story went along, but Maas salted in enough background in unobtrusive ways that if I didn't always know exactly what was going on at first, I was picking up enough to enjoy continuing to listen. Highly recommended. I received a free copy of this audiobook from Audible in exchange for an honest review.",33 people found this helpful,"Standard YA girl series, which I loved","""I've noticed trends in a lot of the YA scifi books that I've read, particularly those with a strong female lead, and this one followed all of them. It has the usual love story/triangle, and the usual rise from the lower class, and a strong female protagonist - which to be clear, I always enjoy, AND, this book still managed to give you a plot line to love, even though you've kind of heard it all before. This one brought me back, I had lost a little hope in the last book, but this book brought me back to loving the story, and I've already set alerts on my phone to remind me to check when the next book will be released.",11 people found this helpful,SOOOO GOOOOD!!,I cannot explain how much this series keeps getting better and better.

Even his actual descriptions of the joy of surfing are interesting, although frequently harrowing. The complexities of his relationships, examination of male friendship, and sensitivity about his treatment of women and his evolution in that area over the years, as well as his relationship with his parents all add to the depth of the book. A peek at the cultures and people in the areas around the world where he traveled are insightful and thoughtful. His reading of the book is a delight.

This book does not quite reach the heights of the books on TR and Garfield. Nonetheless, it's worth the listen. An interesting telling of a story about the British fascination with finding the source of the Nile that not many know about. My listening experience, however, was diminished by the narrator. The narrator is gifted at accents and vocal tones. That made it easy for him to assign each subject person a specific accent and voice. But flipping back and forth to patrician British accents, French accents, mis-pronouncing Spanish accents...it was too much...was very distracting and in some segments cartoonish.

I didn't realize that all the fantasy league play was based on this whole new world of statistical analysis. Lewis writes a good book. Even though it's nonfiction, I have to call it creative nonfiction. It keeps you interested in the story and what's going to happen next, which is why (I think) the movie follows the book so well. But don't be satisfied just watching the movie. The background to this story is another story all together and equally interesting. This book is a solid home run.",9 people found this helpful,Fantastic Examination,"""To begin, I was enthralled with this book from beginning to end. Narration is solid, the prose is entertaining and informative and there is a wonderful sense of accomplishment and wonder in this book. How, armed just with better knowledge, can a significantly poor team like the Oakland Athletics compete, consistently, with the super rich Yankees and Red Sox? That should just not be possible, but it is. And here you'll learn how. It's a story about how a few people tore apart the baseball institutions and put them back together after examining every piece and - seemingly for the first time since the sport was invented - asking if we REALLY know what we think we know about it. For instance, how important are RBIs, walks, stolen bases and home runs? How can you measure the importance of fielding? And what if - just what if - every way we have ever measured baseball is plain wrong. One moment in the book should illustrate how this book is not just fascinating but also transcendent of baseball. We learn that RBIs have been incorrectly evaluated for decades, errors make no sense, fielding isn't measured at all and walks are completely calculated incorrectly. At this point the author asks an amazing and interesting question, if we baseball has been watched live by tens of thousands of people in the stadium and by millions of more on television and YET the wrong things have been measured, then how likely is it that the more subtly things in our every day life have been incorrectly evaluated and weighted? That one thought has actually made me re-evaluate aspects of my job and my life. This book is that good. You should buy it.",2 people found this helpful,Baseball behind the scenes,I am not a huge baseball fan but loved this book and learned so much about the game.

Ironically (?) when he pulls his life together it becomes boring and repetitive. The narrator is ok-but he narrates everything in the same tone, super serious. Appropriate for some scenes, less so for others. Andre is borderline cruel to some people in his past...but I imagine he was encouraged to go back in time to what he actually thought back then, immaturity and all. So, I'm being hard on the book. Ultimately, if you like a compelling story, and have followed tennis, you will like this. Even if you don't follow tennis you will get something out of it, even though the extentive parts will probably be lost on you. To me the most important things are the plight of the child prodigy who gets mercilessly pushed. by his partner, and the young adult who gets pushed by tennis and advertisers as the bad boy, even if it wasn't necessarily the case. I am glad I listened to it, by the way. I can't compare, as I didn't read it, but I don't know if that would have been as good. Ghost writers.

This book is unrelenting in the clear-eyed approach Andre takes to describing his life, feelings, and relationships throughout his amazing career. My only complaint is that the narrator takes an equally unrelenting tone that borders between morose and suicidal. I had to struggle to hear the familiar voice of Andre Agassi in the words being spoken.

Whereas Chris McCandless eschewed societal conventions to the point of wanting to abandon civilization entirely, Pat Tillman defied all expectations by embodying seemingly contradictory roles--the tough, celebrity football player and Army Ranger, but also the sensitive intellectual and homebody devoted to his wife. Not being a follower of football, I was only vaguely familiar with Tillman before reading this book, but I was moved almost to tears by his extraordinary dedication to his ideals and the struggle his family faced to find out the truth about his death. I further recommend this book to any fans of books about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan along the lines of The Last True Story I'll Ever Tell or The Looming Tower (which is referenced several times by Krakauer).

This author debunks these approaches to instead focus on getting a broad array of experiences and allowing uncoached play first before specializing and formal training. After all, he says, you don’t know what your natural skills and interests will be until much later in life. The author does a great job of explaining that skills you’ve gathered in areas unrelated to the field you ultimately focus on is never wasted. It adds to your understanding and gives you a breadth of tools to utilize. It gives you Range. Lastly, I don’t understand reviews that say “it could have been shorter” because the authors point was made much earlier. The stories he shared were so fascinating that I couldn’t care less if his thesis was clear in the first chapter. If you enjoy books and learning stop trying to hack knowledge.

It is for all Americans who like stories of courage and determination and people who have made their mark in history. The story begins as hopeful boys show up at Washington to try out for the university rowing teams. As the book progresses, the teams are chosen and begin their training. Alternately, you will get a glimpse of Berlin as it prepares to host the 1936 Olympic Games. The book goes back and forth between Berlin and Washington until the final American Olympic team is chosen and travels to Berlin. It was interesting to hear details about the sport of rowing which I knew nothing about. I even looked on Wikipedia to see a diagram of the seating positions so I could understand the titles of the different rowers and how they contribute to the overall speed of the boat. What I enjoyed the most was the massive effort made by Hitler and the Nazis to hide the real Germany and appear to the world as a beautiful, peaceful Berlin. There was a little too much character development of each of the boys in the boat, but I suppose it contributed to the overall story.

The subject is right up my alley as is the genre. However (and for me, it’s a big one), the book is so over-written. Why use a familiar word when you can cram in lots of words that show off your vocabulary? Why use ten words when you can use 100? I really don’t know what the author was thinking but it seemed like literary boasting to me, like he’s saying, I will make my account as intellectual as possible to show you just how smart I am and far I had to stoop to actually go on this journey. I seldom bail on a book but I did on this one, I wanted a fun romp and I got a plodding haul. Sure that haul is through one of the most beautiful places on earth but if the language is so overdone and high-falutin’ that the story no longer seems accessible, what’s the point?",3 people found this helpful,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Half memoir, half writing “how to,” it is absorbing and delightful. I recommend it to my students and suggest that they read it every year. However, that is the only one of King’s books that I’ve been able to read. I’ve tried many times, but kept getting bogged down after 20 or 30 pages. The stories were okay, but couldn’t hold my interest because the writing seemed too heavy handed, brutish, like he was typing with his fists. So, after days of consideration, it was with great reluctance that I downloaded 11/22/63. The reviews were good, glowing, in fact, and I’ve learned to trust the opinions of Audible listeners. Plus, the book is more than 30 hours long, which the bargain hunter in me always finds attractive. I just finished it tonight. It is a wonderful and fascinating story, based loosely on an English teacher’s obsession with Lee Harvey Oswald and the possibility of going back in time to prevent the Kennedy killing. I also enjoyed the love story, which the author handles with charm, humor and honesty. The writing is wonderful, masterful, vivid, compelling. The characters are rich and deep, genuine, involved, and I find myself thinking about them and their lives often throughout the day. Life in small-town and big-town 1958 up to 1963 is mesmerizing, much as I remember it, with the constant but subtle hint of mysterious dangers to come. You’ll get no more details from me, only a hearty endorsement. Well worth every minute, made doubly valuable by the excellent and interesting reading by Craig Wasson. Totally believable, wonderfully surprising, and, well, I was going to say something about the ending, but you'll want to find that out for yourself.",770 people found this helpful,Interjections of pesonal politics... blah,"""I may have underrated this title's story rating, as I couldn't delineate King's political sentiments bleeding through the pages and the incredible story. Normally I don't have a problem with authors' personal beliefs as the stories they write are a reflection of who they are, however this one is different. King asserts that the assassination of JFK, portrayed as just shy of deity, resulted in the escalation of Vietnam, MLK's assassination, and a really big stretch to GW Bush becoming president. If he can stop that assassination the entirety of the current world problems never would have come to fruition and our present world would be a utopia thanks to JFK's completed tenure and the resultant butterfly affect. To be fair, this is my first King Novel. I absoluteness loved it. The detail, the imagination, the heartbreak with the obdurate past, had me emotionally tied to saving JFK as well, but King's cri de couer over JFK's death really tarnishes the novel. ****SPOILER ALERT**** The end of the book is where I really had the biggest problem. The entire story is about the butterfly affect i.e., how an action ripples through time and affects something else but really only observable through comparable time travel. King's afterword concedes that he wants to display the worst possible scenario if JFK survives 11-22-63, in order assuage liberal minded peoples' love affair with Kennedy's death. Within 24 hours a sizable earthquake occurs (directly related to Kennedy surviving the assassination attempt), intense seismic activity continues for decades, yet, somehow Bill Clinton still marries Hillary, he still runs for office but dies before he can take office, so Hillary becomes president. I don't know how King reconciles the intensity of the butterfly affect with major seismic activity but other things remain completely unchanged. There are a few other examples of either blatant laziness by the author, or intentional political purveyance. Although his examples are bias, his analogy of a harmonizing effect of the different time strings is insightful. Definitely worth your time, but be prepared to roll your eyes if you don't subscribe 100% to a liberal political leaning.",56 people found this helpful,'Who's the Lovin' Daddy'...Cue the Band!,"You'd think after 50 novels even a distinguished author would be creatively wrung out, cranking out literary Pablum, possibly living comfortably off the body of works from Ago, but no no no...King has somehow evolved--(indentured soul to the devil in trade??). Not only is his writing still inventive and original, it is insightful, intelligent, and intimate, and as is true with the best of the best of them, it reflects true dedication and respect to the art of writing, it is masterful. King's trend away from boogey men (never boogie men--SK likes his tunes) toward the monsters within, is obvious with 11-22-63, and should once and for all show how adeptly King can stand proudly among giants, both literary main stream genre giants and the one-eyed-one-horned slimy kind. Surprisingly, the story is not as focused on the alternate history as it is on an alternate universe, and about what King does best, the story of people in extraordinary circumstances--missed opportunities, what-if's, hopes, dreams, good guys and very bad guys. It's familiar in many ways, even comfortable, loaded with heart and soul, maybe a little sap, and just when you reach for the tissue--out pops evil incarnate (ala Hitchcock-- via Derry, Pennywise, Christine, Lee Harvey, etc.) just to remind you...it is, after all, King, Stephen King. And, if familiar with King, you know it's long (let's not hear anymore about editing), you know it's entertaining, but you may be surprised by the polish and maturity. I've read some critiques that say this is the book King was born to write. Personally, I wouldn't limit such a talented and prolific writer with that kind of statement! Highly recommend; big claps for the meticulous research; kudos for time traveling with flair-not cheese. The narration is outstanding, absolutely equal to the work it performs and should be considered the high mark in audio performance. Could not get better. * If you've read the book or the reviews, how's this for an eerie harmonious coincidence?: I just happened to also be reading Chris Matthew's Jack Kennedy: Elusive Hero, (which I also highly recommend) *shiver moment* and find the research in both books praiseworthy.",41 people found this helpful,,,,,,,

While normally not that big of deal, the fact that there is another version where it does a much better job in those sections definitely lowers the rating. It is still a great narration and highly recommend buying. To those wondering, that is the narration by R.C. Bray and the reason seems to be a disagreement between publishers. Author owns book, another publisher owns the recording of RC, author sold to Amazon, amazon tried to buy recording, that failed, amazon tried to get original author, but that negotiation failed as well. Ah, yes. Since amazon owns the martian or has exclusivity on it (idk which one) the other publisher can't sell it's recording. Soo congratulations on those that have it.

Teenagers are often made to sound much older and most older characters sound toothless. I am about to try the fourth book in the series and hope that the narrator, who did Pillars of the Earth, is an improvement, though I suspect from the preview that some of the subtle tones of Dotrice will be sacrificed for more of a reading than a portrayal.

My favorite books in this series so far are The Outlander and the next one called The Voyager. For all of you who loved Outlander the best is yet to come, just don't buy the unabridged. It is like listening to half of the story. Dragonfly In Amber is not the end of the story just setting up the future stories. Enjoy.",8 people found this helpful,,,,,,,

It's the story of Claire, a nurse in the 1960's, who passes through a magical stone and emerges in Scotland in 1743. It is NOT sci-fi. It is wonderful historical fiction, which is generally not one of my favorite genres. I'm surprised at how fascinating it is to hear details of everyday life from that period and the violent political climate between England and the Scottish highlanders. There is something for everyone in this book, including a wonderful love story. PERFORMANCE - Lovely. That's the word that comes to mind. Davina Porter has a beautiful voice and a melodic presentation. I absolutely love it when a narrator can present decent-sounding characters of both sexes without one or the other sounding weird. Her performance is absolute perfection. OVERALL - There are numerous sex scenes in the book, but they're not overly explicit and they only last a minute or two. There is a moderate amount of cursing and violence. This series is wonderful, but consider the time investment. There are, I believe, eight books in the series, and they're all around 40 hours long. So far I don't regret a single minute of listening and absolutely plan to continue the series till the end. You should listen to the books in order, as each one picks up from the end of the last one, but each ends satisfactorily as opposed to a cliffhanger ending. Highly recommended for adults, particularly females because of the romantic element.",4 people found this helpful,Time travel love story,,2 people found this helpful,A little slow sometimes,This book was great but a little slow in spots.

The world building was intriguing with enough rewarding details to understand for me to keep at it for days or even weeks at a time. The plot does a great job giving you a confusing and deep blank slate, then keeping you excited for the next section of the space to be written in - especially where abilities are concerned. The supporting cast was also very strong, giving some multi-dimensional characters to unpack and even connect with. I only found 2 notable areas where the plot fell short. The book did a fine job bringing different plot lines to intersect, but I've seen much better execution elsewhere. Also, in part due to the laws of the universe and in part due to the nature of MC, much of the story feels of little consequence, with many plot lines just moving the story forward in an expected way, even if the path took a couple extra turns to get there. Then, of course, there's the insertion of a slew of real world political hot topics into the story. I'm not talking about undertones and deep motivating factors in the story, I'm talking literal speeches and sly comments from MC that feel more like skimming a Reddit comment section on socialism than a novelist sharing a thoughtful perspective. Out of the 29 hours of reading, I probably spent 1 hour listening to MC whine about disliking religion and religious people and 3 hours listening to indignant thoughts on class and economic inequality. I've sat through literal sermons that felt less peachy than this story in some parts. A part of me wants to address or refute some of it, but that's not the point. This is a fun litRPG, and it's good at being that. Stop trying to be the next Atlas Shrugged, it's just not working. As a final complaint, I think the author greatly overestimates the effectiveness of talking nonsense to people. If you randomly say Hey you slept with my wife to a stranger in a restaurant (yes this actually happens), they don't stammer about trying to defend themselves and then leave the restaurant forever in shame. They tell you to shut up and stop lying, then go about their day. The book is literally full of this sort of conversation and I almost want to strip another star for it, but I like the world building too much to give a 3 star review.",54 people found this helpful,MC pushes socialism and atheism so hard it hurts.,"""It was a good book fun characters and a really neat world. the magic was also a fun mash up of litrpg and cultivation! that was really cool. the only downside was the literal preaching of socialism and lesser pushing of atheism. Im not against an MC with a strong view, but if they do then they need someone that can actually challenge that view to prove it. not just straw men for the MC to punch in the face. Make him prove his point and tie it to the plot. This book did not challenge the MC much at all. but i still enjoyed the book and will read the next one!",14 people found this helpful,Amao,Book is amazing and narration...

However, I do have some tips for you if you’re listening rather then reading it. The actually hard copy book comes with a map so it’s fun to be reading and flip back and forth between the pages and map to see where he’s describing. Obviously that’s more difficult if you’re listening to it. I would recommend looking a map up on your phone or online of Beleriand and when he starts describing a place to go look for it. It makes the read more enjoyable and you’re not just over whelmed by these random places. My other tip is if you’re wondering who someone is, then look them up online, because the further the story goes it’s cool to see who’s connected to who. Overall, in the end once we get to the third age it’s sweet to see who Elrond comes from and it makes you realize how old Galadriel and Cirdan actually are, and what they’ve both been through. It’s freaking awesome! Also, Andy’s performance was was great as usual! Hope this helps",50 people found this helpful,"Masterpiece, an Oscar Worthy Performance","""I have been through 50+ audiobooks at this point and this is far and away the best, by a wide margin. Andy Serkis lends himself to every single character, perspective, and simply master the poetic nature of the story better than anyone before. This is a man all time performance of an otherwise difficult or inaccessible piece of fantasy told at the level and in the tone of pure myth. Non-fantasy fans will enjoy this as much as avid readers of the genre for the performance alone. The Silmarillion is a history of middle earth and it’s heavenly origin that was shaped and reshaped over the course of Tolkien’s own life, and put into digestible form by his son. It is not told explicitly as a linear story following several major characters, but over the course different eras, major characters rise and fall, without failing in continuity or prose. It gives the universe that Tolkien imagined a sense of depth and expansiveness still imitated but never accomplished by modern fantasy authors. Treat yo’self to this reading by Andy Serkis immediately.",3 people found this helpful,Amazing,Andy Serkis is an amazing narrator. Hundreds of characters in this massive Middle Earth pre-history each are given a unique voice by Andy’s genius as an actor and narrator. The Silmarillion isn’t written like Tolkien’s Hobbit and Lord of the Rings and can be quite dry at times. Andy brings the Middle Earth mythology to life and makes it fascinating to listen to.,2 people found this helpful,,,,,,,

But, the author is turning me off of Casteel bc of the unnecessary and often creepy sexual urges and scenes. In this book, anything turned him on and it was really just cringe. Poppy takes a deep breathe - Casteel's got to immediately take her under a tree. Poppy slays people - Casteel has to pause and push his length into her. The narrator is decent. But during more dramatic moments (which happen often), she makes this broadway stage throaty feathery rumble tremble sound with her voice that makes you feel like a fourth grader being told a scary story by an animated summer camp counselor - only this scary story is about Casteel pushing his firm length into a girl on the battlefield. It is exhausting. The story itself is fantastic. There is a lot going and there are many people and places being introduced.

For whatever reason, whether it be by choice or something else, the first five or so hours of the VO are off. It's possible it was by choice. Maybe TGR felt Darrow needed to sound exhausted, sick, injured. But it was a hard listen at first. And at times it was hard to decipher between Darrow and Lysander.

Frankly the movie stank with comparison to the original book so hopefully this is the original book just re-narrated or re-released.",35 people found this helpful,I read this some twenty years ago,"""I was stuck in the vast emptyness of Yuma Arizona, a one gas station, Mcdonalds, Del Taco kind of place. Stationed there as 19 y/o US Marine I found the whole experience there miserable at best. Then on the second day a lovely young girl gave me this book to read, she said it was funny and filled up the boredom that enveloped Yuma. I took it and read it and loved it. True I do have a warped sense of humor, or at least those who know me would claim. Which may explain my passion for all of Douglas Adams books. Nonetheless, I am looking forward to listening to this book, and after that I'm off to see the movie, well maybe not the movie.

I don't know if I've just had too much time away from the shattered plains but the majority of this book was subpar in comparison to the others. The ending however was that grand Sanderson writing that we all come back for and what a way to end a series. Had a few elements that seemed rushed with the final edit but the over arching story was so compelling at the end and even had a few instances that were hard to gleam from the foreshadowing prior in the book. Over all this is certainly not the best book in this series but for a bridge boom that connected and progressed so much of the story it was pretty darn good. This wasn't no wheel of time Bridge book where you find yourself lost in the bland between very small bits of greatness, this was a storm light book that happened to need to set up a ton of information and plot lines for future books that somehow ended so well and neat. Another great book from Sanderson but like all Sanderson books I'd like to see more of the dark side of human nature and id like to really feel like I can connect to the main characters with thee dark elements of life.",5 people found this helpful,Journey before destination,"""Sandman delivers an amazing addition to the Stormlight archive! This one has it all, AMAZING!!",4 people found this helpful,Dalinar Fu*king Kholin.,"Somehow it keeps getting better. I was so damn excited for this one because I knew it would be Dalinar-focused and I had to know what happened to make this man who he is now. Boy was I not disappointed, 12/10. The character work alone in this one was phenomenal, nearly every single character has caught my attention at this point, but damn is Dalinar good. I don't mean righteous (although he definitely is that also) but his arc has had such and dynamic and enthralling roller coaster of a tale that I would probably throw him up as either my #1 or #2 favorite fantasy character at this point in my library. I kept feeling for him at every juncture in the previous books but since this one with his backstory, I just wanted to give him a hug he felt so real. I could go on for paragraphs about the things I enjoyed about this book but in brief summary; the other characters' arcs still very much hold my interest, Shallan has grown on me. Kaladin is depressed as ever but I've really enjoyed most all of this screentime and probably enjoy him 40% better because of Sly (on that note, the spren intrigue me more each book and I really appreciated the more screen time with them) Kaladin's journey with the bridgecrew was also one of my favorite elements from this one (Michael Kramer uses the same voice for Lopen as he does for Wayne from Mistborn so now Lopen will always have a place in my heart). Adolin's whole story this time around was awesome, from the very beginning I was just on my seat waiting for the other shoe to drop, and the whole investigation arc was really fun. Im glad to see work with the bridge crew and excited to get more. The political machinations of this one were good, hope we see more of these inter-kingdom shenanigans as the war and other disasters start to play out more. The overall story was great and the pacing was good, but there were a few slower parts in this one than in either of the previous books (that being said its 1200+ pages, so that was to be expected). The only part that really hasn't hooked me is Venli (and formerly Eshonai) and their whole arcs, while I understand their obvious importance to the whole story, their individual scenes just didn't hold my interest, hoping this changes later on or on a reread. Overall, excellent execution. Taking a break before jumping into Rhythm of War (which will hopefully get me closer to W&W4 and Stormlight 5) but excited to pick it up from the momentum of this installment. 10/10, 12/10 for Dalinar",3 people found this helpful,,,,,,,

From what I've listened to so far the narrator (Grover Gardner) does a great job! He pulled me into the story with no distracting affectation that you get from so many other recorded books of the horror/fantasy genre. However, the daunting 48 hour listen may have me augmenting the audio edition with my paperback. What other book might you compare The Stand to and why? Grant's Pass - by Amanda PIller. A post-apocalyptic anthology, well written and very fun to read. At times I felt that this collection was the 'lost chapters' of The Stand. Swan's Song - A very good read in the same vein, Robert McGammon is another of my favorites (unrelated but other great books by him: Boy's Life and Going South) The Road - by Cormac McCarthy. Grittier and darker than The Stand but evocative (the book is better than the movie and I liked the movie) Which scene was your favorite? Gosh, so many! - the tunnel, the...hey, I'm not gonna spoil this for first timers! Read it and love it! Once everyone is up to speed, I may update this. Any additional comments? To all those folks who won't read this just because it's by Stephen King - please do yourself a favor and get this book. Although is has some 'horrific' scenes, the character development and story arc are some of the best I've ever read. Don't be put off by his reputation as Master of Horror - he's also a Master Storyteller; remember, this is the same author who gave us Stand By Me and The Shawshank Redemption.

I listen mainly on the way too and from work. This took almost two months to finish. There were times that I was ready for it to be over.. but then something so poignant and superbly written would be read by Grover Gardner and I was in love with the book all over again. I know that King wanted this to be his Lord of the Rings, his epic tale of the fight between good and evil and it was thrilling and gripping and left me laughing and smiling and loving the characters. I loved how well Grover Gardner narrated the different voices for the characters. He truly is one of the best out there. And every time Tom Cullens says, Laws yes, I had to smile. Fantastic book. Don't give up on it- go on the journey, you won't regret it!",207 people found this helpful,A Biblical USA Post-Apocalypse Lord of the Rings,"Stephen King's The Stand (1978/90) was an epic (48 hour!) listen. It's an ambitious novel, a hybrid of post-apocalypse sf like Alas Babylon, epic fantasy like The Lord of the Rings, horror movies like Nightmare on Elm St., and Biblical stories like The Book of Job, all set in a sea of American popular culture. People who like those genres (and don't mind profanity, sex, violence, and many hours of listening) would like the novel. The first part depicts the devastating outbreak of a military plague, the second shows the shocked survivors forming groups around two figures seen in dreams, and the third shows the climactic last stand (for now). King writes a suspenseful plot about human and changing characters. At times Frannie is too teary and Glen too much of a Heinlein know-it-all, but I love the sweet, mentally retarded Tom, the deaf and dumb leader Nick, and the Gary Cooper-esque Texan Stu. The Trashcan Man, Harold, and Nadine are morbidly fascinating, while Randall Flagg (aka the dark man, Satan's servant, etc.) is a charismatic supernatural antagonist. Listening to the novel etched many scenes on my imagination, among them Larry and Rita going through the Lincoln Tunnel, Nick and Tom hiding from a tornado, Joe playing the guitar by a fire, Mother Abigail presiding over a feast, the Kid and the Trashcan Man driving towards Vegas, Harold holding a walkie-talkie at dusk, Flagg interviewing Dana, and Larry, Ralph, and Glen doing a very difficult thing at a washout gully, and Tom, Stu, and Kojak sharing Christmas. Grover Gardner dexterously reads the voices of the many different characters (old and young, male and female, all from different educational, economic, and regional backgrounds) with skill, emotion, and wit. Hearing his Trashcan Man groan to the dark man, My life for you, or his Kid say, You believe that, happy crappy? or his Tom say, M-O-O-N--that spells tired etc., or his Flagg croon, I love to love Nadine, made me walk around imitating them. I can hear them now. Sometimes King overuses certain phrases (as when like a one legged man in an ass-kicking contest pops up twice), or his characters' expressions don't ring true (as when Frannie writes that Harold is a real boogersnot), or he tosses in one too many popular culture references (as when some tires are as bald as Telly Savalas). But I usually found his style vivid and page turning, and at times funny, scary, or moving. I dislike The Stand's cheap association of wolves, weasels, and crows with evil and its moving some of the responsibility for evil away from human beings and towards the devil, but I like its questioning of whether we can escape our fatal tendency towards too much organization, rationality, and technology in favor of free, irrational, and green alternatives: as Stu asks Frannie, Do you think people ever learn anything? and Frannie answers, I don't know.",15 people found this helpful,,,,,,,

I know this is a bully romance but theres no romance and all bully. I can't even like these dudes a little and I do kind of like the girls but even they're a tough pill to swallow sometimes. I really can't get over how such a cool world and an awesome storyline idea got annihilated so terribly. It seriously makes me sad. So, if you're looking for advice on whether you should listen or not, I'll say this - the performance is great and as long as you don't expect anything incredible like I did, you won't be disappointed with a really cool concept.

It is a world of magic and aliens where hurricane-like storms lay savage to the world every few days and all of its inhabitants must adapt their lives accordingly. It is a world at war between the human armies led by High prince Dalinar Kholin and the Parshendi, a humanoid species. We were introduced to Jasnah, who is a renowned scholar and the niece of the High Prince Dalinar Kholin, her student Shallan, and Kaladin, a slave that by the end of Way of Kings is beginning to become the world’s first Knight’s Radiance in centuries. If you haven’t read/listened to ”The Way of Kings,” I would strongly recommend that you do before going on to this second book, “Words of Radiance.” If you have read/listened to the first book I would recommend a review of TWOK before going on since it has been over four years and the second book starts off right where “The Way of Kings,” left off. At 48 hours and 15 minutes this is a long book, in fact Brandon Sanderson posted on his blog that he wrote the manuscript under the working title “the Book of Endless Pages.” He was referring to the endless learning set forth in his first book but it seemed appropriate given its length; but don’t let the length of this book deter you as I listened the hours seemed to fly past. This is an amazing book. “Word of Radiance” focuses on four characters: Kaladin, Shallan, Dalinar, and Adolin. In TWOK Kaladin was the main character and is still very prevalent but this book reveals more about Shallan. Like “The Way of Kings,” Sanderson interlaces the present with the past, developing the background on the main characters’ while moving the plot forward. This is only book two in a ten part series and even though I can’t wait for the next book I found the ending satisfactory. I word about the narrators, I’ve always been a big fan of Michael Kramer and Kate Reading and I thought they gave another great performance.",185 people found this helpful,Sleep....Work...Yea Whatever!,,8 people found this helpful,Brilliant!!!!!!,,4 people found this helpful,,,,,,,

I reserve 5 stars for true epics that I will have to read multiple times. If I could give out tenths of stars I would probably give this 4.6 or 4.7. It is really good. I love the magic structure, the characters, and the class structure built the oppression of one caste of people. It makes for an intriguing story. My only complaint that holds this back from being truly epic is hard to describe. The world feels awefully small in a way. Everything is so homogenous that I don't feel like there are layered cultures to the world created. If it weren't for occasional remarks about the size of this world and the population of cities, I would assume that the Final Empire is about the size of a large island. Great story and I look forward to the next two books.",22 people found this helpful,Creative magic system!,"My favorite thing about Mistborn was the creative, detailed, and rule-bound magic system. A minority of people in the Final Empire have the genetic ability to burn certain metals which provides them temporary powers (depending on the metal) such as enhanced sensations, super strength, detection of other allomancers, influence over the emotions of others, and the ability to push and pull off of metals in the vicinity. Most allomancers can only burn one metal, but Mistborns can burn all of them. I thought this was fascinating and enjoyed hearing how Vin and Kelsier used metals to travel, jump over walls, and fight. I was particularly impressed with the very detailed and thoughtful fight scenes. It must have been tough for Mr. Sanderson to make sure that everything they did with metals made sense physically (there are a lot of opposite reactions to take into account). This is really cool stuff. There are hints and rumors that there may be more metals that most allomancers don't know about, and I'm hoping we'll see some of these in the next book. There was really only one thing that annoyed me in Mistborn, and that was the overuse of the word paused. Almost every page says either Vin paused, Kelsier paused, or someone else paused. The purpose was to show that characters where thinking before speaking, but it started to get to me. Perhaps this was because I was listening to it on audio and the reader said it exactly the same way every time so that it became noticeable. The audiobook was read by Michael Kramer who also narrated the Wheel of Time novels. He always does an excellent job, but I was so familiar with his voices (after listening to every single WOT book this year) that he made some of Mr. Sanderson's characters sound like WOT characters because he used the same voices (in fact, Ham, the big beefy guy in Mistborn had the same voice as Perrin the big beefy blacksmith from WOT).",7 people found this helpful,,,,,,,

Diana Gabaldon paints a wonderful picture and Davina Porter is a fabulous narrator. I love that you know who is speaking before she even tells you.

This tale takes place in a land known as the Seven Kingdoms. However, these kingdoms are actually ruled by a single King with various Lords under him. The history of these kingdoms is expertly blended into the plot, so that you effortlessly become emersed into the world. I can't overstate the skill with which the author draws the reader into his world. It feels as if this land, with its people, traditions and history is as real as our own. Magic does exist in this world, but it is rare. It is used to color the plot, not to dominate it. There are hints of other races, but varieties of humans are all we encounter. There is some profanity, but it's fairly rare and in context. There is some sexual content. I wouldn't recommend this book for children. Large sections of the plot revolve around the palace intrigue of the King, his family and the Lords. This is a book about the nobles of this realm and, as the title suggests, the high stake games they play for power. The characters in the book are deep, colorful and simply splendid. Their lives have a depth to them that few authors accomplish. I confess that, when not reading the book, I actually thought about them during the day and laid awake wondering about them at night. In the audio version, the narrator does a wonderful job of giving voice to these vivid characters. The plot has numerous twists and turns. Sometimes I think the author intentionally speculates about what the reader would expect in the plot of a fantasy novel, and then does something completely different. I gave up trying to predict what would happen, and decided to just enjoy the ride. However, there is an overall master plot that is slowly unveiled in this and subsequent books. If you enjoy fantasy, this is a must read. Even if you usually don't like fantasy, you may very enjoy this one.",375 people found this helpful,Everybody is apparently a chain smoking old man.,,132 people found this helpful,Excellent book; not suitable for children,"I had to cut this book short some months ago when listening with my 12 year old.

Having run out of audiobooks, though, I decided to give this one a try again and really enjoyed it. It's long, and stops just as things are really building up, so be warned. Still, it's a very compelling book with a myriad of well-developed characters that make it hard to hit the stop button.",101 people found this helpful,,,,,,,

My first books by Sanderson were those of the Mistborn Trilogy. I was totally captivated by the story and its writing. I avoided The Way of Kings because of its Audible 2 credit price but finally caved because I had lusted so long for something so good as Mistborn. I should not have delayed. The Way of Kings was well worth the price and promises to be one of the best ever series by Sanderson or any SF/Fantasy author. This is Book 1 of the Stormlight Archive. Coming in at over 45 hours on audiobook or over 1000 pages in print, for some TWoK might seem too lengthy. Personally, for me, it ended all too soon. The book was totally gripping and absorbing. I could not put it down. The writing contains wit and charm, adventure and philosophy, comedy and pathos. It’s all there, a wide range of human thought and emotion. While constructed of multiple arcs, the writing is completely straight forward, accessible and easy to follow. I became totally invested in each character and cared for everyone of the good guys and even some of the bad ones. One of the most interesting characters, one named Szeth, is a peace-loving believer in nonviolence but is also an ultimate, ninja-like assassin who hates to but is forced to kill and cries each time that he does. How’s that for a crazy mixed-up contradiction. Frankly, I think that Szeth is a metaphor for many of us and our behavior. But among my favorite and central characters were a peasant, apprentice surgeon named Kaladin and a spren named Syl with whom Kal has a rather magical and symbiotic relationship. Spren appear throughout the book. They were for me various types of conscious energy or spirit-like entities that were part of or associated with almost everything on the planet including specific kinds of thoughts and emotions, wellness and sickness, life and death. They particularly seem to appear when “change” happens and it is at least at this point in the series difficult to know if they are responsible for, contribute to or are just present when changes in anything from one’s health to the weather occur. Speaking of the weather, the environment and particularly the atmosphere of the planet and how the geology, flora and fauna have evolved within the influence of extreme weather is integral to the storyline. The book describes and develops half a dozen interesting and well defined fictional races. Wars exist on the planet among them over the power and dominance brought by the magical weapons known as Shardblades and Shardplates. And, while war is one of the central themes of the book, descriptions of battles and war do not dominate the narrative. What came across most movingly, uniquely clear and beautifully written were the two human qualities of love and compassion. I do not think that those two attributes have ever been more deftly portrayed than it is in this book. Some of my other favorite SF/Fantasy writers including Dan Simmons and Peter F. Hamilton while brilliant in almost every other respect, fail to adequately communicate those two essential qualities of our nature. Other authors talk about it, their characters go through the motions and maybe say the words but I just do not always “feel the love” in their writings like I do in reading this book. The humanity and heroism portrayed by some of the characters in TWoK were strikingly remarkable. It is another one of those attributes of Sanderson’s writing that makes everything more real and capable of eliciting emotions within the reader. Magic abounds in the book and all of it seems to make sense if ever magic can be made sense of. It was once said that any technology sufficiently advanced will appear as magic and this is that kind magic, magic that can almost be but not quite understood. There is plenty of adventure and excitement contained within the pages and Kate Reading and particularly Michael Kramer bring it all to life. Yes, this is the same duo that narrated the Wheel of Time saga. Their talent was well highlighted there but I believe even more so in The Way of Kings. This was one great book and the only downside is that Sanderson is so prolific with his other literary pursuits that the sequel to this one is long overdue and the Audible rendition even longer than that.",521 people found this helpful,Very Detailed.,"""It definitely earned a five star rating, as sweeping epic fantasies go. Sanderson takes us into the heads of each individual protagonist, and many of the 2nd level characters. The quotes are both creepy and portentous, as well as overdone and vague. The secret behind their harvesting is terrifying. This book starts with a quick dramatic plot point, and then ebbs and builds, slowly, until the last five or so hours, where everything gets tied together, and presents a promising setup for book 2. Brandon Sanderson's writing style, in this book, reminded me of Robert Jordan's; where you'd have these intricate meandering progressions, and suddenly a plot twist would rattle the storyline. I feel it's worth the two credits, and regret waiting for the next book in the series, but at least we're guaranteed it will be out before The Winds of Winter. I'm not the biggest fan of Kate Reading's narration. Something about the way she draws out the words 'eyes' and 'oaths'. She has a great voice and she would be good for a single pov novel, and for R. Jordan's books, since his female characters are all so similar. She's not the best at diversifying her voices, or at male voices, so it's sometimes hard to tell who's speaking. Probably, it's just me, and I'm sorry I couldn't give the book a 5 star narration, as it deserves.",56 people found this helpful,THANK YOU BRANDON SANDERSON (AND KATE / MICHAEL),"Waiting for next Wheel of Time and Song of Ice and Fire...(not holding my breath) Been through Codex Alera, Saga of 7 Suns, Sword of Truth, Mistborn, Prince Roger, Discworld, Deathstalker, etc. etc. etc. Looking for another long series.

Reading this series feels like listening to a Neil Degrasse Tyson lecture on Physics and Cosmology - each narrative construct blows your mind in a new totally unexpected way. Words like original and expansive are completely inadequate to describe what has been done here, it's simply unprecedented. A word of warning, like much SciFi you are probably not here for rich characters and pithy dialogue. Characters here are more like representations of human kind used to fully explore the impacts of radical technological progress on human society. This work is very much at the macro scale of human society exploring such lofty concepts as the nature of life in the Universe, the fate of humankind, and how each of us fits into the greater cosmos. The story starts in our past, but don't let that fool you - stick with all three books and you will be taken to places far beyond your wildest dreams.",4 people found this helpful,,,,,,,

Unfortunately was a bit let down compared to fourth wing performance.

For example the emotional speech between Xaden and Violet at the end of part 1 was spoken too fast and didn’t have the level of emotion expected to match how significant the words spoken were.

Mass has done a fantastic job with her second book in the Throne Of Glass series ; Crown Of Midnight. There is major character development for all of our favorites : Celaena, Nehemia, Chaol, Dorian, and Fleetfoot. I throughly enjoyed the progress of the riddles and secrets constantly unfolding before Celaena. The development of the plot is fascinating and captures the reader with an equal amount of awe and suspicion of what will happen next. Although there are some heart-wrenching soul-guttering moments, it is clear to the reader that far larger schemes are at work in this sequel. Epic praise from me, and all the recommendations in the world for this whole series. Sarah J. Maas used this book as a way to lay the ground work for massive epic stories yet to unfold for Miss Celaena Sardothien and all her friends. I for one, cannot wait to devour the next book.

I slightly agree with another reviewer in saying that the intimate scenes weren't as sexy in her voice but I also find myself a little weirded out being read intimate details so it could just be me.

Her specialty, the theory of constructed emotion, is fascinating if difficult to embrace. As she lays out, we have a centuries long idea that emotions are fixed and common, that they have a certain profile or fingerprint, and (in modern times) many have sought to find their &quot;location&quot; in the human brain. However, Dr. Barrett posits that emotions are not nearly so fixed. Instead, she explains using a blend of studies, experiments, and anecdotal evidence, that the human brain constructs emotions and that there is nothing so simple as a place in the brain we can map that, when engaged, points directly to anger or sadness, joy or desire. The evidence, though counter-intuitive to many, seems to bear out her theory. Among the interesting and thought-provoking points covered include the idea that our ability to catalog and explain our feelings has an impact on how we experience them, that our bodies have resources that must be &quot;budgeted&quot; and that when the budget is stretched it impacts how we experience and construct emotion, and that emotion is different for each person and often different across cultures, generations, and the like, making intuiting the emotions of others no easy task. This book changed the way I think about emotion, offered tools for self-examination, and placed the brain's workings as related to emotion in context that likewise shed light on mental health issues. This is a book I will likely read again to try to grasp more of her points. My only criticism is that at times Dr. Barrett leans too heavily on personal stories or being slightly glib. But on the whole, this was a well written presentation of a fascinating theory.",5 people found this helpful,,,,,,,

Before I had no idea what it entails until I listened to this book.It is ver informative as the author has done a good job in breaking down the jaw breaking language and terms to easy to understand. I enjoyed learning about the theories with little mastering of the arithmetic.,,Great Quantum Physics Primer,"""Early on in the book, the author asks. What is the true nature of the universe? Anyone who's read Douglas Adams knows the answer to that. 42. All these years later, it turns out the reason why it is 42 is because of quantum physics. I am not a science major, but I've always been fascinated by physics and curious about quantum physics. This book provides an easy to understand history lesson on the origins of quantum physics, which is perfect for a beginner like me who is curious and wants to learn more, but doesn't have a science background. Many probably know the thought experiment known as Schrödinger's cat. (Spoiler alert.) Now I understand what an entangled particle is, and I know that if you have one entangled particle in the box and one outside the box, you can understand what's happening in the box without actually opening it. Cool. Apparently, I will also now have an easier time understanding the 2nd Dr. Strange movie, once the version of me in this universe gets around to seeing it. The narrator has a great voice, too.",,Significantly Informative!,"I wish I had this audiobook while in undergraduate. The concept of physics terrified me and I barley got through the courses.

Decades on, Dr Carroll has only gotten better at this. There is something in here for everyone. We go from learning about vectors to Hamiltonian mechanics to Riemannian manifolds. If you know none of this, he'll walk you through it. If you know some of this already, that's ok too; Dr Carroll even leaves room on multiple occasions to admonish his own colleagues (once for conflating time reversal invariance and thermodynamic reversibility, and another for saying time and space switch roles inside a black hole when it is only the corresponding coordinates that do so). In addition to what is strictly scientific, there is philosophy here as well (that classical mechanics is a theory of patterns rather than cause-effect relations - we can work backward from a given state - is a powerful notion any physicist or engineer should get straight, as well as philosophers and laypeople alike). So read this if you like math and physics. Read this if you like philosophy. Read this if you finally want to understand the Twin Paradox. Heck, read this as a zen koan if you must. But please read this.

Part of the difference lies in the narratives that have been built around the great men of these sciences, from Pascal, Descartes, Newton, Leibniz to Einstein and Stephen Hawking. This book makes up for the difference by contributing to build this narrative around a few of the great men (and women) of Information & Communication Science and Technology. Not all of them arelarger than life figures, or true geniuses, but they probably contributed to the progress of humanity more closely and directly than their forebears in the physical and mathematical sciences.

Personally I enjoyed the story because I relate to the author and his views on how to live a fulfilling life. From his youth he has been educating himself in science and math, improving himself, understanding how the world works. This man did not limit himself to one ambition or one career or one goal. He learned how science explains the physical world around us, how mathematical patters can predict all kinds of scenarios that seem random to most of us. I added Edward Thorp to my list of successful, rich geeks like Howard Hughes, Elon Musk, and Bill Gates. His story is an inspiration. What did you like best about this story? The author's intelligent approach to success. Have you listened to any of Edward O. Thorp’s other performances before? How does this one compare? After listening to this book I wanted to learn more about this genius that I never heard of before. I listed to some of his interviews. Was this a book you wanted to listen to all in one sitting? The fist half yes, I wanted to keep listening and enjoyed every bit of it. The second part dealing with finance takes more time to digest some times so it's better to pause otherwise a lot of good information just blends and mixes together and gets forgotten. Any additional comments? This book makes you want to be smart and successful. Even though the author is a born genius, he provides a lesson that education and ambition go hand in hand on the road to success. You have to improve yourself in order to get what you want in life.",21 people found this helpful,Many sound lessons,"""Many good lessons can be learned from Thorp's interesting career and family. Although he's a science oriented thinker, his Warren Buffet hero worship is a little ridiculous. He tells the usual and mostly accurate 2008 crisis etiology.

Section on Bioethics explore the slippery slope of allowing humanity to change their own genes, from treating diseases to producing designer babies. The section on Coronavirus elaborated how the time of crisis brings the entire world together to solve a problem that affects all. the innovation and collaboration spawned by COVID taught us how the basic sciences can find practical applications in matter of months and not years.

I can not stress the importance of this excellent and dynamic story. Walter Isaacson is a master at taking a very advanced technology and breaking it down for easy understanding. Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier, two very different personalities won the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. This is the first time in history that two women achieved this prestigious award for the same Science of Chemistry. The story starts off with a little girl, Jennifer who's father gives her a copy of the famous book The Double Helix by James Watson and Francis Crick as she learns of the most important detective story in history. Jennifer also finds out about Rosalind Franklin, who also could have won a Noble prize if the timing to her discovery was recognized correctly. Today we face the fact that through genetic modifications our science has the ability to modify our genes even down to the Germ line, which is where babies are created. We can fix broken genes to cure diseases like Huntington's or Sickle-cell anemia and many more by inserting corrections or by removing broken genes and completely change the direction of society if we so choose. Science as in all things can be used for positive or negative solutions.

However, I was repeatedly dismayed at the odd gaps it seemed to have and the bias it sometimes showed. The audiobook production was very good, though some of the sound effects came across as trite. I'd recommend it, but you may need to fill in the gaps to have the complete picture. As far as gaps: - It talked about the growth of the Army Air Corps, but made no mention of Billy Mitchell - It talked about the Air Corps Tactical School not having books or journals to read, but there were some books on the subject available to them, including Douhet's Command of the Air and a few others - It talks at length about the Norden bomb sight and the problems with it but doesn't talk about its overall effectiveness or repairs to it - It didn't even mention Doolittle's Raid, even when talking about the bombing of Japan - It mentioned both atom bombs but only mentioned the Enola Gay In terms of bias, the author clearly respects the hardline members of 'bomber mafia' mindset, even when they fail to get results. However, he seems quite opposed to Curtis LeMay and clearly likes Hansell. His approach to this doesn't seem at all balanced.",2 people found this helpful,Gladwell does it again!,"Malcolm Gladwell has done a superb job of chronicling the technical, personal and strategic development of one characteristic of warfare that has carried forward from the onset of WWI to the present day..

Her cancerous cells had the ability to be cultured and grown - an ability that is not present in most cells. The rare ability for these cells to be grown in culture provided a cell line that was used in the creation of the polio vaccine and numerous other cures. The cells themselves did not provide the cure, the cells provided a means in which researchers could study a disease and develope a cure. The book was written because for years, the identity of the donor of these cells was only known as Hela. Neither Henrietta or anyone in her family received and compensation or, until relatively recently, any notoriety for these cells. The author fairly protrays that, for the era in which these cells were obtained, there was nothing wrong, illegal or underhanded going on. Procedures such as informed consent were non existent in the 1950's. I was left with the feeling that the Lack's family should receive some compensation for Henrietta's cells. Not because they have a legal right to compensation (which is questionable) but because it is the right thing to do. Although the book is supposed to be about Henrietta, almost half (sometimes seemed like more) of the book is about one of Henrietta's daughters. This may interest those who develop a personal interest in the Lacks clan, but has little to do with the cells and was distracting. You will be disappointed if you want to learn about the cells themselves, as the author only provides general descriptions and there is little technical information provided...this book is about people. That being said, there are some very good sections where the truly unethical behavior of doctors using these and other cells is described. They are quite disturbing stories. The last hour of the book is a discussion by the author over the ethics of cells and tissues and who really owns them.",23 people found this helpful,Great Listen,"""I thought the weaving of the different characters was expertly done, loved the audible interview with the author at the end. great read - couldn't stop listening!",20 people found this helpful,The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks,"I was hesitant to listen to this book.

How much you will like this book depends on your expectation. You will find it enjoyable and informative if you want something quick, light, and practical.

Research in this book was 10/10. Well researched and had a sizable list of cited sources and authors. Writing was 5-6/10. At various points I zoned out for a minute and the author was still belaboring the same point without adding anything new or interesting. Concision is not something this point does well, and it’s also bad at signposting where the author is going with things. Voice performance 10/10. I was impressed that the reader got all the academic words and even the french terms correct. Engaging way to listen to it. Analysis was a 6/10. Let me preface by saying I disagree with the central thesis of the book, namely that egalitarian models of human society which existed previously can be emulated today. With that bias aside, I assess that the authors play fast and loose with their analysis. Several case studies point to of ancient civilizations and basically say: “We don’t see anything hierarchical, therefore we have to conclude they were egalitarian.” Not the case; they need positive evidence to make a positive case for their model. All they’ve done is try to shift the burden of proof onto others. That being said, there were a lot of subclaims I found interesting and insightful. There are a lot, and I do think some of their better analysis does deserve mention. In particular, I liked their takedown that individuals had to organize into states and that the march to modern nation states was inevitable. Likewise they did a good job of showing that civilization and technological development (agriculture, metallurgy) are not linked. Overall: 8/10. The book has a lot of interesting analysis, though the main thrust of it is pretty shaky. The writing could be improved and shortened. Overall I enjoyed, and I thought the audio format was actually a good way to digest it.",9 people found this helpful,RELIVING THE PAST,"""David Graeber and David Wengrow persuasively reject the view of farming as a critical step leading to tribes, hamlets, villages, cities, and future nation-states. Graber and Wengrow’s archeological research reveal human remains and structures are found in many areas of the world long before any evidence of farming. Their research suggests hunter-gatherer populations created and sustained stable communities with remnants of worship, government rule, and tools for construction, punishment, and defense. These early civilizations knew nothing of or practiced any form of organized farming. The goal of the author’s research is to find an answer to the question of why inequality plagues civilization. They suggest inequality is (in part) created by the myth propounded by stories like the bibles’ garden of Eden. The myth of original sin and redemption sets many precedents for inequality and redemption through good works. Their archaeological research suggests the plague of inequality has never been cured because history and archaeological evidence shows civilization wobbles between extremes. First, there is the altruism of sharing benefits of life with everyone. Second is the realism of what is mine is mine. Graeber and Wengrow argue there is history and archeological evidence proving both extremes exist but the second prevails more than the first. It would seem the first is more likely to preserve humanity, and the second to end it. This is not light reading or listening, and it remains a speculative story of civilizations’ growth, and organization. It seems a more careful examination of archeological evidence than the farming explanations from different authors like Fukuyama, Diamond, Pinker, and Harari.",3 people found this helpful,Listen to the Sample First!,"Several reviewers have complained about the reader; I think he’s fine.

The focus of the book is the anti-communist witch-hunt (and personal vendetta) carried out against Oppenheimer. There is very little technical information about the building of the atomic bomb, but this did not detract from the fascinating story of his life. By the end of the book, when they get to his security hearing for the Automatic Energy Commission (his trial for communist connections), I was transfixed and could not shut this thing off.

Learning the interrelationship between different species of trees, soil fungi, and their environment was mind opening. I had never considered plants to have intelligence but this book makes a compelling argument for that concept. If we could only speed up time and see underground, we would have a much different comprehension of how sentient trees are, and how much more animal plants can really be. My main complaint about the book is the constant anthropomorphization (sp?) of trees. Yes, the author is trying convince the listener how willful and intelligent trees can be, but he hits you over the head with the cudgel of the metaphor that trees have human qualities. After fifth or tenth time he makes the comparison, I found myself yelling back, BUT TREES ARE NOT PEOPLE. If you can get over this, the book is quite enjoyable. Only complaint about the narration is a silly American-English annoyance. The reader pronounced fungi as FOON-GEE, instead of FUN-GUY, and hearing this over & over eventually got on my nerves.

I read about half of Behave (it’s like 700+ pages) and got distracted by life. When I saw this book was coming out, I was so pumped. Probably the first time I’ve been excited for a book release in about 20 years. Sapolsky makes a rather convincing argument about the nature of freewill and the implications of his argument are incredibly liberating.

From what I understand the author has no formal background in biology, he majored in math and economics in college and was involved in AI-related technologies later. However, I'm really impressed by his overall understanding of basic biology. I'm only 1/5 of the way through the book but so far I've really enjoyed this listen -- and I've been learning some things along the way about early animal evolution that I have not heard before. For example, why the evolution of bilateral symmetry may have arose: to aid locomotion -- and how this led to what the author labels the first major breakthrough in intelligence evolution. Bilateral animals evolve to go really fast only in one direction, when we want to go in another direction we turn to face it and then run (think about how slow you would run to an object 90 degrees from you if you could not turn and run toward it). But to coordinate the decision making process on which way to run required primitive bilateral organisms to process a multitude of signals (coming from many different cells) and coordinate the response. Thus we can begin to understand why complex brains arose in mobile multicellular animals and not in plants or more 'primitive' radial symmetric and less mobile creatures like sea anemones. The author then ties in this first step in the evolution of animal intelligence to the makers of the first commercially successful robot, irobot's Roomba vaccum cleaner by 3 members of MIT's Artificial Intelligence lab. Looking forward to the rest of the book and congratulations to the author on his research and on how well he explains things and a very interesting read (audible)!",,A Must Read For All AI Scientists,"""I have always looked for a book just like this one - compiling cutting edge neuroscience into a form that can be viewed through the lens of current AI developments. I am inspired to bring some of the key insights here into my own work in AI systems. Much credit should be given for the depth and breadth of research shown here. It lends strong credence to the cogent model of intelligence proposed within. In my humble opinion, a must read for any AI scientist.

The book was more of a review for me as much of the subject matter has been discussed on his podcast StarTalk, which I've been a fan of for a number of years. Still, it never gets old listening to Neil talk about the cosmos. He is an excellent communicator and has a knack for explaining the complex concepts of astrophysics so that even those of us without science degrees can appreciate and understand them. If you liked this book and have an extra hour a week, I highly recommend Neil's StarTalk podcast. The podcast is co-hosted by a comedian and Neil usually has an interesting guest and takes questions submitted by listeners. Guests range from astronauts to fellow scientists to celebrities who are interested in science. The comedian hosts are usually either Leighann Lord, Chuck Nice, Maeve Higgins, or Eugene Mirman. They keep the show's tone light and funny.

Instead of treating patients when they're sick or broken, why not keep them healthier longer? I already was aware of a lot of the general information but this is a good synthesis, and Attia has a missionary zeal to help more people live better longer. I have two minor negative comments. First, Attia's a high achiever, which is great, and also a relentless name dropper. Got a little distracting. Second, I didn't expect it to be so much of a personal memoir. I'm glad he got some help for his own mental health, but I was less interested in how his workaholic over achieving temperament turned him into a raging jerk and landed him in residential treatment. I had listened to a podcast with Freakonomics author Steven Levitt and that included most of the relevant information, with less of the personal mea culpa from Attia. In summary, great data about nutrition, exercise and sleep, but unless you have a personal interest in his residential treatment, you can skip the chapter at the end about his emotional turmoil.",12 people found this helpful,Two best versions of Peter,"""I'm an avid listener of Audible but seldom write reviews, this one will be my first one, but I really felt compelled to write it as I was so grateful after reading it. I was initially quite unimpressed during the beginning of the book, which deployed several tactics already discussed elsewhere and in Peter's podcasts . In the beginning of the book found the chapter on stability the most useful. The first part of the book is Peter-mind-of-steel, the sharp, decisive, clear, assertive Peter. Nothing very new, though. The second part, as I would call, is Peter-heart-of-gold, where Peter exposes himself with a courage I never saw in other authors in the same genre. This second part is the jewel of the book, inspires and touches as Peter show immense courage to share his stories , his challenges, his deepest shadows and wounds, and his insights. And it shines light on the first part as well. I found the epilogue brilliant, bringing unity to the whole book, and the acknowledgement session is the best I have ever read. Being myself also a medical doctor , a seeker of the truth , a perfectionist, struggling with my inner critic, I found immense value on the insights of this book. Hope this review inspires you to read the book and that my comments don't have any spoilers .",7 people found this helpful,Most books suck. Not this one.,"Dr Attia makes the complex understandable.

More specifically, ‘All Rhodes’ and ‘Torn’. It’s definitely slow, but at least it's slow out of necessity, not because the author knows we crave character intimacy and stalls just because. Obviously it’s going to take quite some time for a 38yo man to give in to the temptation of his son’s 19yo girlfriend ??. The story starts really well, with a meet cute. Then it slows right down into a slice-of-life kind of thing. The author lets you live in the mfc’s skin - Jordan is a small town student, and bartender. She has a good head on her shoulders... mostly. On the plus side, while you wait for the two main characters to give in to each other, their heads are filled with lots of shameful yearnings and secret lust. Yummy. Cons? The way the whole cheating subplot was handled was EXTREMELY unsatisfying. Jordan accepted betrayal easily, in a sort of adolescent, self pitying way. The last 2.5 hours particularly sucked. When once again, Jordan crumbled rather than shun or beef with Cole. That scene where she leveraged sleeping beside him, a cheater, just to get a rise out of (mmc) Pike ??. It was too damn much. What about some personal dignity Jordan? Shortly after that the author began heaping misery on Pike (unnecessary misery imo, yes he made their relationship difficult, and yes he was conflicted about banging his kid’s ex, but rightfully so). Their separation was a huge letdown after such an intense love affair - in the last 45min the author introduced like 3 new NPCs and tons of irrelevant, frivolous bullshlt. The energy felt completely different. And Cole! ??. Throughout the whole book the guy was a dumpster fire and a real ??. He never got parented or karma’d. He felt like a loose thread, more catalyst than character. I wanted to see an emotional showdown between him and those he’d hurt the most. When he ducked it all and joined the Navy I had my fingers crossed that he'd die in a war. No such luck he gets an HEA.

There were a lot of good characters that lost their lives, or the lives of their loved ones.

Cassandra Campbell’s narration is beautiful. I am not well acquainted with Carolina accents, but Campbell’s inflections seemed believable and allowed the reader to feel immersed in that marsh world. Her gentle Kya voice helped bring both the child and the adult to life. Somehow she managed to differentiate the speech of each character and to capture personalities perfectly. And the characters were so well-drawn that I felt as though I would recognize them if I saw them. My favorite aspect of the book was the marsh itself, and Owens’s knowledge of the ecosystem— the birds, grasses, trees, shells, and waters. I plan to buy the hardcover to reread those many sections again. Her references to Aldo Leopold and to other foundational environmental literature seemed as natural as Kya herself. There is no overt campaign here to save the wetlands, though they are as sensitive and threatened as Kya. The plot itself isn’t unique or original, and it’s easy to predict where things are headed. It doesn’t matter. I was unsure of the resolution till the end. However, I’m not sure I loved the ending. I think it went at least one page—maybe one chapter—too far.

I really liked all of the characters, I found them relatable and loved how different they all were and I truly loved how Kristen was so far from perfect. And Josh might be the perfect me! I think that what I liked the most was that the story felt original, after thousands of contemporary romance books they all start to feel exactly the same and this one didn't. The subject matter really was hard and I know a lot of people feel like it should have been handled different but honestly I don't think there is a right way to handle this from the characters perspective, everyone is different and everyone has a different threshold for how much they can handle and how they handle it. I will say that I would have liked it even more if Kristen would have just talked to him instead of keeping it bottled up for sooooo long, that felt a little like drama added to the book for the sake of drama. I loved that it had a happy ending, while probably not very realistic, this is fiction and romance so I expect that. The narration was perfect!

My only ask is for duet style audio. The narrators are two of my fav though.,,Book 1 was so fun I needed more,"""After binge reading my way through The Graham Effect, I knew I would be excited for whatever came next in this series. And when I started reading, I quickly realized that The Dixon Rule was an even better read. I adored Diana and Shane. Their forced proximity, enemies to friends to lovers, fake dating story was cute and a very fun read. When Shane proposed a FWB relationship, I laughed knowing Elle was setting them up for a delightful failure. These two were meant to be. I also grabbed the audio to switch between listening and reading. Just like the previous book, The Dixon Rule was an amazing audiobook with narration by Covin King and Erin Mallon. Erin has long been one of my favorites for her comedic nuance and Corvin King is quickly becoming one of top narrators. They made me laugh and swoon, making it the perfect audiobook for me! Diana is a busy woman who works hard to make her own way in life. When Shane moves into the apartment next door, she quickly sets some ground rules to keep his party boy lifestyle in check this summer. As the two spend more time together, staying annoyed with each other becomes harder and harder. When Shane’s ex shows up with her new boyfriend, Shane begs Diana for help. She reluctantly agrees to be his fake girlfriend, but their little lie slowly becomes more as the weeks pass. Neither was looking for a relationship with the other, but will they be able to keep things fake for long? I thoroughly enjoyed the love story in The Dixon Rule, but I will say that there were plenty of laughs to be had as well. Between Shane and Diana’s friends, HOA meeting shenanigans (if only real HOA meetings were this enjoyable), nosy neighbors, and bonding over reality TV, this story was light and fun even if both characters had exes to deal with before they could really settle into their HEA. Both Shane and Diana were easy characters to like and I adored how they teased each other. This series has once again proven to be a super fun read and a wonderful love story that makes me look forward to whatever comes next for the series.",,Sports Romance ?? ??,"This Audiobook made me laugh, scream, and get teary-eyed. There was so much happening between Diana and Shane, but they worked through it by communicating like adults. Diana was a refreshing FMC who was strong with a vulnerable side. Then Shane comes off as a player but is a loyal golden retriever. My heart broke for him and Diana, only to be mended again with their HEA. The bonus epilogue was spicy AF ??. I'm invested in Will and Beckett’s story. This book is not a dark romance, but I found some topics to be more triggering because they were realistic situations.

I know it's billed as dark, so as with the last dark romance I listened to, it's on me for continuing to listen in spite of the distaste I felt. Dark romance is certainly not something I regularly seek out, but I love Troy Duran's work, so I try to listen to one of his books that is completely out of my comfort zone every so often. His narration and Michelle Sparks', who is new to me, performance are truly flawless, and are the ONLY thing that made me see this one through. Troy's mastery of accents is amazing -- the Italian, oh my, and I loved Michelle's Australian accent, too! I know sex sells, but there is such a thing as overkill, and this book definitely fits that bill; and how on earth two people can be continually attracted to one another when they have a bone-deep hatred and are terribly mean to each other, is beyond me. Sexual tension or not, two broken, messed up souls or not, you can't tell me such attraction can realistically be sustained long term, let alone lead to love. Yes, I know this is fiction, and perhaps the goal is to allow readers/listeners to live vicariously through the characters to experience something they otherwise wouldn't, but good grief, there is more to life than sex. What could have been a much better story, given the mystery surrounding the lighthouse and Sylvester's creepiness, was swallowed up in one meaningless sex scene after another. Even after all that happened and the unique, heartfelt way Sawyer was able to put her past behind her in the end, I felt nothing, no connection to these characters, and that is a big must for me with any book, connection. The tender moments between Enzo and Sawyer that are supposed to make us believe they have truly fallen in love, rang completely hollow. Authors of dark romance, this author included, need to understand that when it comes to the spice factor, less is often more, otherwise even the most avid fans could become tired and disillusioned.",27 people found this helpful,Wowzers!,"""Okay these Narrators were amazing.

Enzo is a dark brooding guy who has been hurt in the past and when these collide you know it’s going to be anything but dangerous! After realizing what Sawyer took from him he hunts her down and takes her out for boat ride, the boat ride turns into a nightmare as a storm tosses them overboard and they have to fight to stay alive in the deadly sea! They wash ashore on a deserted lighthouse, but it’s not actually deserted. And old man named Sylvester resides on the island and he takes care of the abandoned lighthouse. After a few weeks staying with him strange things start to happen and Sawyer and Enzo realize they have to put their hatred for each other aside and work together!

Riveting & Emotional!,"Wow, I love, love, loved this book, Catherine Cowles never ceases to amaze me with her brilliant mind and ability to create stories that not only captivate my attention, but tug at my heartstrings, too, a story that will stay with me for a very long time. “Fragile Sanctuary” is the first book of her new “Sparrow Falls” series and is a small-town romantic suspense featuring Rhodes and Anson. There are some great secondary/support characters and I am looking forward to their stories, too. Rhodes suffered from a devastating loss when she was 13 and her life was forever changed. Fourteen years later, she is ready to face her past and returns to her childhood home with plans to bring it back to its glory. She has her brother Shep working on the house and he brings in his friend Anson, a restoration specialist. Rhodes and Anson’s first interaction did not go so well, the man is a grump like no other, but Rhodes does not let that bother her. Rhodes is living on the property while the house is being worked on, so she gets to see Anson often, and she sees beyond the facade he has put up. Anson has had his share of loss and not only did he build a wall around his heart, but he prefers to keep his distance from everyone. Despite everything Rhodes has been through, she has a sunny disposition, which warms Anson's icy demeanor. It was wonderful to watch their relationship blossom, and I thought they were great together and for each other. When her past comes back to haunt her, he goes into protective mode. And when his past comes back to haunt him it, he remembers why he never allowed himself to get close to anyone and his guilt surfaces over what happened in the past. I loved how everything played out in this book, all the layers to the story and the complexity of the characters. As always, the writing, plot and world building are phenomenal, as are the character growth and development. The story has the perfect balance of drama, angst, mystery, thrilling suspense, heartfelt emotions and steamy romance. The suspense storylines are well crafted; each time I thought I had it solved, I was proven wrong, resulting in a surprising ending. Catherine Cowles, thank you for another amazing story and emotional rollercoaster ride.  ?????? Andi Arndt and Zachary Webber did a fantastic job bringing these characters to life and did so with a complete understanding of who they were portraying, and I loved how they took each role and made it their own, sounding believable and just as I imagined the characters to sound. Webber’s Anson was spot on, perfectly grumpy, and he grew as his character did. Arndt was just as amazing as Rhodes, grasping her sunny demeanor. Both were fabulous performing the roles of the secondary characters, too. They set the right tone for the story, captured all the characters’ emotions and had you feeling them all. These two entertaining storytellers are a pleasure to listen to and their performance elevates this already amazing story to another level. Thank you for another fabulous listen.",,An amazing story with incredible narration,"""I seriously think this is my new favorite of Catherine Cowles books! I am a sucker for a grumpy sunshine story, and Anson was so deliciously grumpy. Zachary Webber did such a great job bringing Ansons character to life! And umm excuse me!! The spice! ?? this is Catherine’s steamiest book yet and I AM HERE FOR IT!! Once again the suspense blew my mind l was so confident I had it figured out and nope the rug was ripped from under me. Once everything was revealed I was soooo shocked! Seriously, if you’re a small town romantic suspense lover, this book is perfect! I highly recommend listening to it, Andi Arndt and Zachary Webber truly bring these characters to life and make this such a vivid and amazing listening experience!",,4 words Zachary Webber & Andi Arnt !,"My Goodness !!!! How do they do it ? ?? These are the only 2 narrator's that should be on Audible, seriously! Shane East is good too, Andi & Zachary need Oscars ???? There's is no one else that comes close. Zachary W. has one of those voices like Morgan Freeman, u know his voice as soon as u hear it, yet can play multiple roles. U get so caught up in Zachary's performance, u forget the characters don't exist! Andi is the perfect female narrator! There is NO other female on here, that's on her level! ????I won't even listen to a story if they're names aren't on it. Real talk! If u guy's are reading this, You're the best !

Just don't want to commit to that much time. But I didn't know this was a series until I had read/listened to the first one, my favorite so far, btw (It was my first Audible book). I will finish the series, but not all at once. I probably won't get around to #6 until next summer. But I'll look forward to it then. The only reason I gave it 4 stars as a story and overall is because it is just so long. And the repetitious nature of certain things, like the love making.

The first book in the series, Spark of the Everflame, just came out on audiobook earlier this month and you better believe that I had already pre-ordered it and squealed when I saw it instantly download in my Audible app. If you are not familiar with this series, Spark of the Everflame is a new adult fantasy romance, but really light on the romance particularly in this first book. There’s angst, sass and amazing tension. We have one hot and heavy scene rolling around in the woods and an incredibly soul, consuming kiss but this is really a story of our main character Diem her self discovery and her fight against the injustices of the Realms. Experiencing Spark of the Everflame as an audiobook after already reading all three books that are out, was such a great experience. I feel that the narrator really captured Diem’s sarcasm and attitude perfectly. As a second time “reader” I had soo much fun finding all the Easter eggs that Penn put into Spark and even though I knew exactly was going to happen I found myself sitting on the edge of my drivers seat anxious and eager to hear more. My love for Spark never waned but listening to the audiobook absolutely fueled my flame for this series. Please, do me a favor, do your self a favor and read or listen to this book.

She and her father are estranged, but she’s living with him and working for him for reasons bigger than herself. She’s expecting to just survive this year of working for her dad, but with Sean and his group of friends, everything changes. I love books that make me think, make me feel, and keep me guessing. This one did all three. I’m so glad I had no idea what this was about. I’m glad I went in blind and was surprised with each twist and turn. No one crafts a story quite like Kate Stewart, and I was blown away by this one. It was on my mind for days. I couldn’t stop thinking about what happened, what’s happening, and what will happen next. I have so many theories! This story is unique, it’s twisty, and it’s insanely sexy. After finishing book one, all I have to say is to buckle up, ya’ll. You’re in for a ride!

The motivation and action of what keeps the pace moving felt a bit disjointed at times. Cecilia as a character has very little for me to hold on to and want to keep going. I think that if I were just reading I might have not finished, but by listening to the audio I felt Joe and Maxine were giving me an audio play of epic proportions. They feed off of each other magnificently and like the talented performers that they are they knew how to play to their strengths and keep up the interest where otherwise the action would have stalled. Maxine is a complete and utter rock star carrying much of the narrative but giving this 19yr old girl some grit and nuances that made her more interesting. Cecilia is on this journey to self discovery and Maxine gave her the voice of strength that I needed to hear so she didn't seem whiney or a complete hot mess. Joe Arden, I can only imagine, was having a ball playing a wide variety of male characters and giving each one depth, personality and interesting quirks. His character voice choices were spot on and he played each one with conviction and outstanding dominance. I am a huge fan of these narrators and having them perform duet style is a real treat. If the story fell a bit short, it was their narration what made me want to continue and finish. Bravo!",2 people found this helpful,HOT HOT HOT!,"5/5, HOT, yummy goodness!

Work goes by faster. Stressful car rides are not so stressful. And doing the laundry is not that bad anymore. That is definitely the case with Wild Love. I love Elsie, she knows that. I ADORED this book. I adored the characters, the town, the story, everything—and when you add Zachary Webber and Vanessa Edwin? Is there a more meaningful word than perfect? If there is, let me know, and I’ll lead with that. Ford and Rosie have known each other since they were kids. Ford is Rosie’s brother’s best friend, and they argued and bantered and annoyed each other growing up. On the surface, at least. Now they’re both back in their small town, just as he finds out he may be a little girl’s biological father, and just as that little girl enters his life. I have to say it—Zach’s kid voice is precious, but so was Vanessa’s. Cora comes out so amazingly in their voices that I fell in love with this kid all over again. Ford and Rosie end up working together, which is hard for Ford. He’s been pining for her for years, and their banter is just their own brand of love. Including those emails, because… I have no words. The blue pen moment? Perfect. The desk moment? Flawless? The blue paint moment? Don’t even get me started. All the tension was spot on, the way a slow burn should be. Zach and Vanessa made me giggle and squeal and tear up. And hot. Because you know all the tension had to go somewhere! The little things and small moments melted my heart. His acts of service, the romantic words that may not have sounded romantic to Ford at all. The hair pulling. The journal. The dock. All of it is so special. All the love and the jealousy and the want and the longing came out exceptionally in the voices of these two people, and I’m in awe of them. This book had me feeling everything. This audiobook made me feel… more. It’s indescribable, and it’s an experience. The perfect couple that is Rose and Ford played by two people who were the best for the job. Spot.

It was different from your typical single dad book. Speaking of being a dad, every single scene with Cora was great. I loved her with Ford and I loved her with Rosie. Rosie was a great heroine. She was so much fun and such a hoot. I rooted for her and I loved her with Ford. And can we talk about the bowling dads? So hilarious! I hope they all get books- especially Rosie’s brother. Wild Love is such a character driven novel and I loved that. These characters were everything and made the book for me.

I cannot stop thinking about these characters---they are so compelling. I thank Audiblebooks so much for my finding the Outlander series---I am obsessed.

But, I'm fascinated by history and have always loved speculation on things such as standing stones etc. I am also of scottish decent and have spent considerable time reading about and researching my heritage and I enjoy the slant that the author puts on highland history. For the most part I think she portrays everyday things about 18th century highland life very believably... er... other than the way the main character GOT to 18th century scotland... But even that is a fun idea. So, yes, there is a lot of romance novel to wade through... but just enough history to keep me reading the series.",10 people found this helpful,Unabridged only please,"This series starts with Outlander when the main character Clare is in her 20s.

My favorite books in this series so far are The Outlander and the next one called The Voyager. For all of you who loved Outlander the best is yet to come, just don't buy the unabridged.

It's the story of Claire, a nurse in the 1960's, who passes through a magical stone and emerges in Scotland in 1743. It is NOT sci-fi. It is wonderful historical fiction, which is generally not one of my favorite genres. I'm surprised at how fascinating it is to hear details of everyday life from that period and the violent political climate between England and the Scottish highlanders. There is something for everyone in this book, including a wonderful love story. PERFORMANCE - Lovely. That's the word that comes to mind. Davina Porter has a beautiful voice and a melodic presentation. I absolutely love it when a narrator can present decent-sounding characters of both sexes without one or the other sounding weird. Her performance is absolute perfection. OVERALL - There are numerous sex scenes in the book, but they're not overly explicit and they only last a minute or two. There is a moderate amount of cursing and violence. This series is wonderful, but consider the time investment. There are, I believe, eight books in the series, and they're all around 40 hours long. So far I don't regret a single minute of listening and absolutely plan to continue the series till the end. You should listen to the books in order, as each one picks up from the end of the last one, but each ends satisfactorily as opposed to a cliffhanger ending. Highly recommended for adults, particularly females because of the romantic element.",4 people found this helpful,Time travel love story,,2 people found this helpful,A little slow sometimes,This book was great but a little slow in spots.

But, the author is turning me off of Casteel bc of the unnecessary and often creepy sexual urges and scenes. In this book, anything turned him on and it was really just cringe. Poppy takes a deep breathe - Casteel's got to immediately take her under a tree. Poppy slays people - Casteel has to pause and push his length into her. The narrator is decent. But during more dramatic moments (which happen often), she makes this broadway stage throaty feathery rumble tremble sound with her voice that makes you feel like a fourth grader being told a scary story by an animated summer camp counselor - only this scary story is about Casteel pushing his firm length into a girl on the battlefield. It is exhausting. The story itself is fantastic. There is a lot going and there are many people and places being introduced.

I'd been avoiding Emily Henry solely because I didn't want to be let down by all the hype. I can honestly say that the hype is valid. This story was such a sweet almost reverse small town romance. It gave a voice to a different type of leading lady, one who enjoys work but isn't typecast as a workaholic and someone who doesn't want kids but also cherishes her nieces. I loved how the author effortlessly blended character traits that are normally associated as negative traits for women and made them valued and accepted. The romance was prominent but I wouldn't say the entire story revolved around it. The FMC has more going on and the romance was almost secondary while also providing humor and love when the FMC needed it most. This book is a love letter to readers and the book industry. It cherishes family bonds and the importance of finding your people in the world. The reason I'm rating this 4/5 stars is because I felt like I wanted more from the romance. Maybe I'm just stuck up but I think having a dual POV would've made me fall so much more in love the MMC. I found myself wishing I knew what he was thinking or what was happening behind closed doors to him. But I tend to struggle with single POVs anyways. It's just my preference! ?? Overall Story ????

A general warning though, it can be a little frustrating towards the beginning of the novel but not in a bad way. In the complete way that you, as the reader, realize the right thing to do/say but you understand fully why the character doesn’t see that path. This novel, brought to life wonderfully in audio by Kramer and Reading, pulls you towards the characters and you might find yourself falling in love with them as they fall for each other. As for other standouts, the world building feels complete and realized without being overdone. The cultures and customs are odd but in a way that a new culture in the real world might appear odd. This, I think is an achievement considering the fantastical nature of the world. There is also a fresh exploration of themes pertaining to lies, mistakes, forgiveness, tradition, and many others. The exploration of these themes was done well enough where I found myself arriving to the conclusions Sanderson was pointing towards before they were fully realized in text.

Unfortunately was a bit let down compared to fourth wing performance.

For example the emotional speech between Xaden and Violet at the end of part 1 was spoken too fast and didn’t have the level of emotion expected to match how significant the words spoken were.

She’s living in her late grandmother’s house and starts going through her great grandmother’s diary, which leads to a murder mystery from the 1940s where her great grandmother had her own complex relationship with a stalker. Honestly those excerpts were the most interesting part of the book for me. ?? I never felt the romance between the hero and the heroine, he just wanted her and she enjoyed and got off on the fear.

I don't mind a little of erotica, but these scenes tend to go on and on and on. They don't advance the story at all, in fact they offer an unwelcome pause to the plot of the book.

But I think I enjoyed Amanda more? I thought she did a great job. She made Mor sound a bit Irish which was weird and of course, I hear everyone else in my head differently than she performs (I read this book in hardback first and then listened to it) but I still found myself engaged in the story and could differentiate between the characters through her performance so that was nice. I slightly agree with another reviewer in saying that the intimate scenes weren't as sexy in her voice but I also find myself a little weirded out being read intimate details so it could just be me. And the other narrator sounded much older than Feyre is supposed to be so who wins really? As for the story.... OMGBESTILLMYHEART. Rip me open why don't ya. So many things to say about the story but I don't like spoilers or anything that could make people guess or think they know what's happening so, I tell you nothing. It's a roller coaster.

But at the cost of killing two innocent fae. So the last book ended with Feyre having to deal with the aftermath of her actions and of dying and being resurrected as a High Fae. If you come into this book curious about how Feyre is coping. Or wanting to know what was up with Rhysand stumbling during his last interaction with Feyre. Or what is up with the bargain he made with Feyre. Or what exactly began Tamlin and Rhys' enmity. Or what are the other courts like. Or what the hell Feyre's last name is. Then your curiousity will be satisfied. However, if you come into this book with a high investment on who Feyre ends up with, all I can say is that you will either be very elated or crushingly disappointed. Personally, I like the book and its continuity with the first book. I like how the author handles Feyre's character development for this book. I don't really care much about who Feyre ends up with as I like both the guys introduced in the first book. But from a shipping perspective, I can pretty much see how a reader rooting for one guy would be enraged or elated at how the romance department goes. So just be prepared Finally, I just want to comment that this title should not be under the Teen category. If you're a parent who has any plans on buying this for under 17 children, you might have reservations because this book has even more graphic sex scenes than the first book.",114 people found this helpful,Narrator is absolutely breathtaking,"""Narrator was fricking amazing. she gave each and every character a special voice and tone.

And I stress this is merely a theory (a rather titillating one but a theory nonetheless) that makes far too many assumptions based on how words are adopted into different languages. The narration is excruciating. It sounds like a bored British Civil Servant reading a dry economics report. I find myself unable pay attention for long stretches only to find that I didn't really miss anything. Just another long list of sumerian words that really mean penis. And wow those Sumerians were sure obsessed with the penis. Look, I don't want to demean the work of a noted (and now dead) scholar who seemed to be really excellent at deciphering dead languages. It's just that there seems to be too much of a leap of logic here. We used to be told that we shouldn't take the Bible literally.. now we are supposed to believe it's full of hidden dick jokes??

Especially, when my own church went the way of progressive Christianity during the height of our countries racial and political divide. We needed the church to be unified as the body of Christ, with sound biblical convictions at the helm. This was not a war between two ungodly men. This was a war between right and wrong. And policies that would make or break our country. I got this book as a last ditch effort to try to understand where Beth was coming from.

Dana has given me the permission I need to throw away and donate stuff instead of just figure out how to reorganize the stuff we have spilling out everywhere.

I recall reading this book 25 years ago and being very impressed with the depth and scope of the message Gary Zukav brought to our planet. I have always felt that this book brought my perception of our world to a place it had never been, even way back then. Yet, with two young daughters to raise and many other profound books along the way, I lost my focus on what I had learned when I read it so many years ago. So, I was browsing Audible for a book to use my monthly credit on and I came across Seat of the Soul and thought to myself Well, I have already read it, is it worth using my credit on it? As soon as I asked the question, my intuition spoke to me in a very strong way. It left no doubt that I needed to revisit this book again. So I started to listen to the book and have been put in a state of awe, in a state of humbleness and gratefulness. It is almost like my own Soul was speaking to me. I am not sure why, maybe because I have more experiences behind me, maybe it's the fact that Gary Zukav is reading his own words and it allows me to absorb the concepts that he is conveying more deeply, or because of the countless spirituality books that I have read over the decades, all I know is this audio version is bringing me to an understanding of myself and our world like I have ever perceived. The wisdom of this book is timeless.

That's kind of putting this great book in a tiny nutshell. The first time I read it, I found myself sharing some of the author's insights with my teen granddaughter. Each of my granddaughters requested journals for Christmas as a result. I recommend this book for anyone who thinks. As a disclaimer, I'd like to say I've lived long enough to know that sometimes words hit differently depending on how and when you hear them. If you don't get something from this book, I recommend reading again later down the line.",5 people found this helpful,,,,,,,

Do the New You,Religion & Spirituality,Steven Furtick,Steven Furtick,,9,42,2/13/2024,21.83,362,4.9,5,4.9,346,12,3,1,0,333,9,2,1,0,325,16,3,0,1,Do the K(new) You!,"Do the k(new) you. The knew you might feel new, but it's the you that God created before you were born, before He created the world. It's not new news to God, the author and creator of it all. He's always had a plan and a future for you—yes, you! The 6 mindsets from my head pastor at Elevation Church, Steven Furtick, are designed to keep your mind renewed. The Bible calls us to renew our minds. Romans 12:2 says Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will. (NIV). There's no question about it, I know like me, you want to know the plans and the will of God for you, your family, and your lives. Pastor Steven coaches those who accept the calling to read or listen to the message that God delivered to him through the Holy Spirit. The Bible is God-breathed; it's inspired and written through the Holy Spirit and by men of God—so too is this book. Of course, no book is comparable to the Bible, and that's not my intention here. I only mean that this book is no gimmick or marketing scheme to make sales or empty promises; it's God's word expounded differently—and it hits so good! The 6 Mindsets 1.) You're not stuck unless you stop. 2.) Christ is in me. I am enough. 3.) With God there's always a way, and by faith I will find it. 4.) God is not against me, but he's in it with me, working through me, fighting for me. 5.) My joy is my job. 6.) God has given me everything I need for the season I'm in. With each mindset, you're renewing your mind as God's word calls us to do. Pastor Steven uses incredible and unique Bible stories to break chains and set God's people free. Like Moses, he leads God's people into freedom. Joyce Meyer famously says that the mind is the battlefield. The enemy wants to continue to toss wave after wave of confusion into your life. He wants to blow you off course. But God. 1 Corinthians 14:33 says For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints. (KJV). The enemy has distracted you long enough! Take your mind back. Take your life back. Find your life that's hidden in Christ, the k(new) you. Colossians 3:1-4 says Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things. For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God. When Christ, who is your life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory. Tune your mind, heart, and soul to truth, tune it to God. Maybe you're scared to get out of the boat. Maybe you're out of the boat, walking on water, heading toward Jesus just like Peter. The wind and the waves come, then we sink. The 6 mindsets are designed to keep our eyes on the Author of Life (Jesus), so we can either start or continue to walk on water with Him. Defy the critics. Defy the odds. Defy your enemies. With God all things are possible. God is calling. Listen. Will you accept the call? As Pastor Steven says, God chose you, will you? Disclaimer: This isn't a one time read it and forget it book. It's a read it one time and I'm hooked for life kind of book. I compare it to the Bible in this way: that you'll refer back to it as often as you need it and you'll find that you'll need it as often as you continue to do the k(new) you and live for God to bring Him glory.??",5 people found this helpful,Praise God for this amazing audio!,"""Great direct life application.

"The Kingdom, the Power, and the Glory",Religion & Spirituality,Tim Alberta,Tim Alberta,,18,16,12/5/2023,25.19,1223,4.8,4.9,4.8,1082,92,31,9,9,1036,88,21,7,4,1011,93,35,9,8,Clearity Within The Fog,"This book is a must listen for anyone that wonders why these days the Evangelical Christians seem to be so ... extra. I grew up Evangelical Christian in the 80s and 90s, however I no longer consider my self part of that religion. My faith is in Jesus alone - no others. My disillusionment started when I was 19 (in the 80s), and I began to see my local Minnesota pastors setting themselves up as celebrities that treated their churches more like a high-growth business than a ministry. Huge auditoriums, high schools, TV shows, theatrical and musical performance were all designed to bring in people and (in my opinion) raise weekly income exponentially. The church I called home had a pastor that started out by leading a bible study, but by the time I decided to quit, he would arrive in a limo, directly speak to only the powerful in the church, owned a huge house on the lake, and seemed to care more about making his church big than actually being a shepherd of his flock. So I walked away holding my Lord in my heart rather than on my sleeve. Once on the outside over the years, I've observed the church through the eyes of my family. My mother still holds to the values of the 80s style beliefs that hold Christ above all others, She used to be a power force in her church, but today she has a very private, personal relationship with Jesus and doesn't frequent services very often. My brother on the other seems to have dove head-first directly into the populist lake of a celebration of Trump. He goes to rallies, proudly displays his Trump Leadership Certificate, surrounds himself with only like-minded Trump loyalists, while (as Tim Alberta points out continually in his book) pushes those that don't believe in Trump away from him. It has been an interesting journey over the years trying to parse and interpolate those two dichotomous beliefs, but I could never get a handle on **why** the Evangelical church lost its way. What happened to the preacher that now treats the service like a campaign rally? When did the pursuit of money and power become a central focus rather than caring for those in your community with need? How did the message of Christ - of love and ministry - become a message of hate and exclusion? I would, on occasion, quiz my brother on these questions, but it always would end up in my frustration that he was afraid of everything they would take away from him and his family (though he couldn't really define who they were or how they materially affected his life). Once Trump entered the conversation, there was nothing that would reason with him. And, after being cut off a number of times, I simply stopped trying to understand or criticize. (though I still ...stand at the door and knock... from time to time) Alberta's book helped me understand clearly what my brother couldn't explain. Tim clearly walks through the link between who the Church used to be and how it is now. He deftly weaves his way between the various belief systems and churches of the Evangelical faith, and his reporting of his experiences with different, prominent Evangelical and SBC thought leaders helped me understand the state of the church today. The most revealing part of the book for me was Tim's journey from pastor to pastor across the country, and how some have turned away from Trump while others still hold loyalty to him. Tim contrasts the Evangelical Church's pursuit of power and wealth and actual words of Christ, and he give a broad survey of the state of church and how it may (or may not) move forward. One day, I hope we can all look back with incredulity and disbelief of a time when Christ's Church went astray -- and then came back to Him. I join Tim in believing in an optimistic outlook, and I have faith that Christ will restore people's lives - even if we may not call it the Evangelical church anymore.",2 people found this helpful,"Understanding, Insight and Hope","""Tim Alberta pulls back the curtain on the damaging influence of Christian Nationalism to the Evangelical Church. Beginning with his own upbringing in an Evangelical church in Brighton, MI where his father, Rich Alberta, served as the Senior Pastor, he takes the reader on a whirlwind national tour of the hot spots where politics on the right have overtaken the biblical message of Christian faith and discipleship. As a follower of Jesus and a respected journalist, Alberta exposes the myriad ways the good news of Christ has been bent and perverted into a limited game of power politics. It was surprising to discover the depths of group think that has taken place as a cultic non-biblical dogmatism has arisen which has caused pastors to either conform to keep their attendance up or to take a courageous stand resulting in loss of attendance, insults and personal threats. Alberta, the Journalist, allows charlatan preachers to tell their own story. Alberta, the theologian, brings in relevant scripture passages that reveal the deception of their culture-bound preaching and teaching. The author demonstrates the damage to the church being done by political operatives. What appeared to be once healthy churches, now find their congregations either far from the Christian faith in a new and strange temporal political action committee type of community or decimated in both worship attendance and financial support as they seek to faithfully live into lives that mirror the life Jesus in our time. The first two parts of the book tell stories of the lurch to the political right taken by so many Evangelical Churches. The third part of the book tells the stories of those who are helping followers of Christ find new ways of biblical discipleship, peace-making, and community service. The Epilogue brings a message of hope and new pathways for understanding how the church can move forward. Don't miss this last part. It is likely the most important chapter in this book. A companion book or sequel could written that documents the influence of the political left on mainline churches. In any case, the issues of cultural influence on the church and the church as a cultural influence provides an endless field of inquiry as followers of Jesus seek ...to act justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with (their) God.

He's the kind of guy you would wanna sit on the porch with a drink a glass of iced tea. Not at all a typical preacher. What insight do you think you’ll apply from The Purpose Driven Life? Gosh, way too many to list. Way too many. So many good quotes (not just biblical either) and so many good insights based on common sense...I think that it made me see that life s worth living...which I didn't think it was before. Any additional comments? Give it a listen! Well worth your time!",50 people found this helpful,Very good book.,"""Overall I think this is a great book that puts a lot in perspective for the ones that believe in God!

It adds another layer of depth to the already deep text of Scripture. I wouldn't use it to supplement my study, but it's wonderful to just sit and listen to. The only actor I really don't care for is Jim Caviezel as Jesus. I have certainly enjoyed Mr. Caviezel's performances in movies, however there are times when I think he makes Jesus sound weak, almost frail when he should sound authoritative, for example in the book of Revelation. In some other portions of Scripture Jesus' speech would naturally sound quiet and even comforting at times. But He is still the Alpha and the Omega, the Son of God Almighty, to whom all power is given in heaven and earth. At the times when He is demonstrating those attributes Mr. Caviezel falls short, in my opinion. Overall, this performance of God's Word is excellent and I highly recommend it.",50 people found this helpful,,,,,,,

I will make this honest & to the point. As I am Australian we kind of like our info served straight up and no beating around the bush. I get tired of reading reviews that sound over the top of many peoples heads & those that make you wonder if they were paid to write it. Let me tell you this, from start to finish this guy knows his stuff. These Love languages Dr Chapman talks about transcend culture & speech language. They would work for anyone, anywhere in the world that has a desire to seek more from their partnership and is willing to listen. Dont let his funky southern accent put you off, it will actually endear you to him as you grow to admire his insights and find your own penny dropping inside. Everything he said made sense, plain english and would apply to everyone's situation whether married, in a relationship or not. Its real info that can be used to reopen and then keep the channels of communication open between partners. Also info that will make giving & receiving love as well as being lovable so much easier. It doesnt focus so much on the differences between men and women like in the Mars Venus Series of John Gray but more on the WAY we love. It explains why those suggestions you get in magazines dont always work so well. SO refreshing and info that I didnt even know I needed! Our marriage was in a rut & I can honestly say that when trying some suggestions from the book my husband immediately responded. He even wanted to listen to the book with me and we disussed things as we listened. It has brought us so much closer and helped us to connect again while learning more about ourselves and each other. We plan to go further with our reading as we have a new hobby, listening to books together. I hope Dr Chapman will keep writing!

My wife has divorced me and has another man living with her and my 2 sons in the home that we made. This book has helped me realize how I failed her but, it has also given me hope. I now realize I still love her even if she no longer loves me. I only hope that by trying to love her now, the way I should have when we were married, that she will someday be able to forgive me for the emotional and psychological suffering I put her through.

My wife is reading the paperback and I am sure it will be as valuable to her as it was to me. I have a feeling there was a higher power behind that sunset, maybe even divine intervention. The sunset that day was representative of the power of now. The clouds formed a floor and ceiling with the sun in the middle. The floor and the ceiling were the past and the future and the beautiful sun was representative of now.

Comer had me laughing and feeling other emotions throughout the whole book. I highly recommend this book.",,An Honest Look at Hurry and Living at Jesus Speed,"I want to start this off with something completely honest. I felt guilty listening to a book about eliminating hurry at 1.75x speed. As this is my normal listening speed, I didn't change it because listening at slower speeds really seems like a crawl for me. Having said that, this book really has been life-changing for me. There are so many points in the book where I stopped, thought about where I am in my life, and prayed how I could eliminate the hurry I feel in that part of my life. I've pared down my closet to 7 sets of clothes (I need to go ahead and pack the rest.) I've learned to spend more time with my family in a calm, slow, manner away from the television (we're still working on phones.) I appreciate John Mark Comer's honesty in the struggles he has faced in becoming a less hurry-oriented person and the great examples he gives from his mentors and Biblical examples. The importance of being with people in the moment is one of the greatest takeaways I have from this reading. I think my greatest lesson from this book is how important rest is to God for us. Jesus tells the Pharisees that the Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath. The Pharisees needed to hear the second part. We, in our 75 mph in a 65 mph zone, looking for every shortcut available, travel ball every weekend, lifehack mentality really need to remember that the Sabbath was made for our sake. This is a book I will listen to several times to see where my walk with the Lord measures up and to make sure I am not hurrying ahead of where he wants to walk with me. I recommend this to every Christian, but especially those of us who are part of the hurry-up society. Take your time. Slow down. Maybe even set the book speed to 1.5x instead of 1.75x.",,,,,,,,

She deftly wove together her own experiences--what brought her to seek therapy and her experiences with a skilled therapist--and detailed narratives about a few of her own patients. Parts were laugh-out-loud funny, while I was also brought to tears several times (and even once in any book is fairly rare for me). The level of empathy in describing the patients makes it almost impossible not to also empathize, and the psychological insights about both herself and her patients provide enough food for thought to make a re-listen worthwhile for that reason alone. The narration was pitch-perfect for storytelling and dialogue, and always with the right emotional resonance. I actually checked several times that it wasn't read by the author because the tone was so absolutely perfectly that of a therapist speaking empathetically to a patient. 5+ stars, will totally recommend to my therapist! :)",6 people found this helpful,I've never finished a WHOLE book.,"I don't like to read because I lose focus fast and find myself having to reread pages way too often.

Of course the real payout is if you can sell the business in 24-36 months for real capital. You will still need to work about 3000-4000 hours a year. But most business owners do that anyway.

The first thing I want to say is that you should listen to Think and grow rich (Napoleon Hill) before you listen to this book. It will help you to follow the author's mind. Another thing is that Sharon Lechter brings NOTHING more to the book whatsoever. It was actually really annoying having to listen to her whenever she comments as it brought nothing more to what Hill was already saying. Another thing is that she keeps pushing her book 3 feet from gold and that too was really annoying. Sharon Lechter doesn't comment too often so it's no TOO bad. This being said, I HIGHLY recommend this book. It is a big eye opener on the keys to finding success in your life! Seb",9 people found this helpful,"Life changing book, commentary is really bad.","""Must read. This is the most impactful book I’ve ever been exposed to. Powerful book.

Embarking on a self-development journey over the past three years, I've grappled with my own limiting beliefs, much like anyone else. WORTHY goes beyond shattering those constraints; it's a profound revelation of understanding one's inherent value. It's about standing unwaveringly in your truth, even when your voice quivers. Finishing this book left me with a profound sense of gratitude, realizing there's still much work ahead, and I'm privileged to contribute to the positive impact it will have on countless lives. One line, nestled in Chapter One, resonated deeply: We become what we believe we are WORTHY I've practically highlighted every page, and I'm committed to sharing the invaluable tools and wisdom Jamie Kern Lima has generously bestowed upon us.

I'm so happy she narrates this herself. Through her vulnerability and passion to share this message of self-worth, Jamie helps us open our eyes and our hearts so we can see where we are now and where we can be no matter what mistakes we’ve made in the past and are still judging ourselves for. And it’s not just theory, she provides tools (such as The Four Rs to Transcending Rejection) and relatable examples to give us those aha moments and the courage to take the first step.

Definitely Recommend it.,"There is so much you can learn from this audio book. So to learn about yourself and the way you relate to your partner, your children, your peers, your family and anyone you have a relationship with. That said, the focus is on couples relationships. I liked most of this audiobook, and wholeheartedly recommend this listen (or read if you have the print). The only thing I didn’t agree with was the part where they mention if you are one attachment type, say anxious and your partner is avoidant type, that you two are incompatible (specifically during dating). However, they do mention something critical about the main body of research, and it is that attachment styles are not permanent. People who want to change their patterns and behaviors can do so by learning and applying what they learned and by applying secure style behaviors vigilantly. Thereby, their attachment style remains dynamic. You can start out as anxious and move into secure. You can also move from secure to avoidant. It all depends on the partner and what attachment style they are exhibiting and whether or not the partner desires to change their own patterns and behaviors for the betterment of the relationship.",2 people found this helpful,Everyone Needs to Read this Book,"""This book is extremely enlightening, well-written, and thorough.

I generally find the self help genre weak and I expected this title to be one more christian based positive thinking book. There is a tiny bit of faith-based stuff in the afterward, but it strives to be any-god-will-do. Mostly it is detailed, ordered, steps to, over time, improve your effectiveness. The Seven Habits (plus the new eighth one) are: Be Pro-Active, Set Goals, Prioritize, Think Win-Win, Listen, Synergize, Maintain, & Inspire This list seems a bit trite, but the author takes care to build each concept upon another. It is more realistic than most self-help books and does not promise a quick fix, or riches, or power, it instead suggests an effective pattern for somewhat steady improvement. This system goes beyond having a open mindset to having an abundance mindset. This does not mean an abundance of stuff, but noticing that many situations are not zero-sum, and that win-win net-positive situations are often, if not almost always, possible. Of course doing all the things the author suggests is non-trivial, but they are generally good suggestions for making progress once you are committed to change. The writing and narration is quite clear, folksy, and pleasant, and far from the exuberance of some books in this genre. Some may find the folksiness a bit slow and boring, try speeding it up.

If you’ve been following his lectures on YouTube, you will hear many things in this book that you’ve heard before, and others you have not. I have only two criticisms; the first, and and the lesser of the two, is that he spends a bit too much time on some rather rambling personal stories for my taste. Peterson has so much to say of great importance, I find myself a bit bored with some of the extended stories of his growing up. The second criticism, the more substantial one, is that I would prefer he spend less time on the explanation of religious archetypes. While I find some of that interesting, I think it takes up too much of this book. Considering that there’s nothing in the title that would suggest a religious bent, I’m afraid it might turn some readers off. Those two exceptions aside, I enjoyed this book a lot. And more than that, I found it insightful, engaging and important.",13 people found this helpful,,,,,,,

Instead of treating patients when they're sick or broken, why not keep them healthier longer? I already was aware of a lot of the general information but this is a good synthesis, and Attia has a missionary zeal to help more people live better longer. I have two minor negative comments. First, Attia's a high achiever, which is great, and also a relentless name dropper. Got a little distracting. Second, I didn't expect it to be so much of a personal memoir. I'm glad he got some help for his own mental health, but I was less interested in how his workaholic over achieving temperament turned him into a raging jerk and landed him in residential treatment. I had listened to a podcast with Freakonomics author Steven Levitt and that included most of the relevant information, with less of the personal mea culpa from Attia. In summary, great data about nutrition, exercise and sleep, but unless you have a personal interest in his residential treatment, you can skip the chapter at the end about his emotional turmoil.",12 people found this helpful,Two best versions of Peter,"""I'm an avid listener of Audible but seldom write reviews, this one will be my first one, but I really felt compelled to write it as I was so grateful after reading it. I was initially quite unimpressed during the beginning of the book, which deployed several tactics already discussed elsewhere and in Peter's podcasts . In the beginning of the book found the chapter on stability the most useful. The first part of the book is Peter-mind-of-steel, the sharp, decisive, clear, assertive Peter. Nothing very new, though. The second part, as I would call, is Peter-heart-of-gold, where Peter exposes himself with a courage I never saw in other authors in the same genre. This second part is the jewel of the book, inspires and touches as Peter show immense courage to share his stories , his challenges, his deepest shadows and wounds, and his insights. And it shines light on the first part as well. I found the epilogue brilliant, bringing unity to the whole book, and the acknowledgement session is the best I have ever read. Being myself also a medical doctor , a seeker of the truth , a perfectionist, struggling with my inner critic, I found immense value on the insights of this book.

Clearly Mr. Goggins has confronted and overcome significant obstacles in his lifetime and can serve as an inspiration to all of us. That said, not everyone will feel the need to take self improvement to the nth degree, as did Mr. Goggins. I was somewhat put off by his drive to compete constantly.

There are some applications for specifically what I was looking for based on the title and the many glowing, life changing reviews.. But I was looking for a book to deal specifically with avoidance behaviors. That is addressed in this book, but this is more of a book for those who have experienced trauma (and yes, I know we all have to some extent), or have been wired in ways that set one up for self sabotage, mostly on a spectrum of medium to high self sabotage. The first half of the book, while I'm sure it will speak to many, did not speak all that much to me. I found myself agreeing with the first half of the book, but not feeling that these were necessarily the issues that I was struggling with. Still I believe that for those looking to redirect negative self talk, self doubt, trauma, etc., that the first half of the book would be not only applicable but probably just what they need to hear and unpack. The second half of the book went more into mindset, mindfulness, expectations and action steps, once you've worked on what may have gotten you in such a negative space to begin with. I'm happily married, running a successful 30 yr real estate business and pretty self actualized, self confident and positive most of the time. That said, the second half of the book was a good meditation on subconscious thoughts vs conscious thoughts, self evaluation and self redirecting, all in a broad sense. Good for anyone, anytime, including me. The book mentions, accurately I think, the quantum field, mind-body connectedness, habit rituals, and more. I found some real quotable gems in the second half that I found myself compelled to take notes on. Then I found myself wondering, who is the author? I found this book from a recommended book list (I forget from who). So I looked up the author, Brianna Wiest, expecting to find a 40 to 60 yr-old woman with a background in marriage and family therapy, or psychology of some sort. To my surprise, Brianna Wiest (if I'm not mistaken), was 28 when she published this book. An author of some acclaim but mostly a modern-day writer of non-fiction and poetry. Wise beyond her years is an understatement! But a well-adjusted, well-spoken and even thought provoking writer who just feels called to help people find happiness and a better life. Commendable! I typically listen to any worthwhile audio book 5 to 20 times if it hits home. Repetition is the mother of all learning, as they say. So I'm going to give this book more listens to digest what I think are thoughtful, caring and sound ideas and principles. If you struggle with PTSD, or any kind of self sabotage on a scale that is holding you back, I would recommend this book. The author is impressive for her wise-beyond-years outlook on how to do more, be more and find happiness. (Sorry for the long review.

I can't imagine todays leaders embracing him at all with his rhetoric on personal accountability or the way he talks about the democrats buying the black vote with zero results to show for it in the actual community. We see the same thing today, Black people continue voting blindly democrat with nothing or little to show it for it. The ghettos still exist and the discrepancies still exist no matter who we vote for. In part because I believe people miss the message of accountability and the lack of real interest by politicians beyond self promotion and power. There is a constant movement to lower the bar so to speak for people instead of building them up. This is exactly what Malcom X stated time in and time again. Oh, I think most would hate him today. The reliance on government was something he spoke about avoiding at all costs. What the black community really needs is to be built up to start with education. This means holding teachers accountable for results in the black community. Malcom X has a sense of community that is truly beautiful and he found it through religion. I have always said despite my atheism, there is merit in the community that religion can bring. Today this community idea is dying. We simply slap band aids on gaping wounds. Where I did struggle with Malcom X thoughts, his view on history. Why? Well it simply isn't correct. Many of the colored empires as he describes them, were also founded on the blood of conquered peoples to include slavery and sacrifices. To praise an empire like the Persian Empire and attack another that was formed the same way, either speaks of world ignorance or willful ignorance. Either way, his view on history is uneducated at best. However, I don't think that takes away from his message, his importance and what should be an even larger more taught legacy. I highly doubt many people who talk or use Malcom X to add validity to their points today have actually read him. I truly believe if he were alive today, both political parties would hate his message. One thing is for sure, the average American reads 4 books a year. So, more than likely if you are debating about Malcom X, you are debating someone who has read nothing.",2 people found this helpful,,,,,,,

I grew up Evangelical Christian in the 80s and 90s, however I no longer consider my self part of that religion. My faith is in Jesus alone - no others. My disillusionment started when I was 19 (in the 80s), and I began to see my local Minnesota pastors setting themselves up as celebrities that treated their churches more like a high-growth business than a ministry. Huge auditoriums, high schools, TV shows, theatrical and musical performance were all designed to bring in people and (in my opinion) raise weekly income exponentially. The church I called home had a pastor that started out by leading a bible study, but by the time I decided to quit, he would arrive in a limo, directly speak to only the powerful in the church, owned a huge house on the lake, and seemed to care more about making his church big than actually being a shepherd of his flock. So I walked away holding my Lord in my heart rather than on my sleeve. Once on the outside over the years, I've observed the church through the eyes of my family. My mother still holds to the values of the 80s style beliefs that hold Christ above all others, She used to be a power force in her church, but today she has a very private, personal relationship with Jesus and doesn't frequent services very often. My brother on the other seems to have dove head-first directly into the populist lake of a celebration of Trump. He goes to rallies, proudly displays his Trump Leadership Certificate, surrounds himself with only like-minded Trump loyalists, while (as Tim Alberta points out continually in his book) pushes those that don't believe in Trump away from him. It has been an interesting journey over the years trying to parse and interpolate those two dichotomous beliefs, but I could never get a handle on **why** the Evangelical church lost its way. What happened to the preacher that now treats the service like a campaign rally? When did the pursuit of money and power become a central focus rather than caring for those in your community with need? How did the message of Christ - of love and ministry - become a message of hate and exclusion? I would, on occasion, quiz my brother on these questions, but it always would end up in my frustration that he was afraid of everything they would take away from him and his family (though he couldn't really define who they were or how they materially affected his life). Once Trump entered the conversation, there was nothing that would reason with him. And, after being cut off a number of times, I simply stopped trying to understand or criticize. (though I still ...stand at the door and knock... from time to time) Alberta's book helped me understand clearly what my brother couldn't explain. Tim clearly walks through the link between who the Church used to be and how it is now. He deftly weaves his way between the various belief systems and churches of the Evangelical faith, and his reporting of his experiences with different, prominent Evangelical and SBC thought leaders helped me understand the state of the church today. The most revealing part of the book for me was Tim's journey from pastor to pastor across the country, and how some have turned away from Trump while others still hold loyalty to him. Tim contrasts the Evangelical Church's pursuit of power and wealth and actual words of Christ, and he give a broad survey of the state of church and how it may (or may not) move forward. One day, I hope we can all look back with incredulity and disbelief of a time when Christ's Church went astray -- and then came back to Him. I join Tim in believing in an optimistic outlook, and I have faith that Christ will restore people's lives - even if we may not call it the Evangelical church anymore.",2 people found this helpful,"Understanding, Insight and Hope","""Tim Alberta pulls back the curtain on the damaging influence of Christian Nationalism to the Evangelical Church. Beginning with his own upbringing in an Evangelical church in Brighton, MI where his father, Rich Alberta, served as the Senior Pastor, he takes the reader on a whirlwind national tour of the hot spots where politics on the right have overtaken the biblical message of Christian faith and discipleship. As a follower of Jesus and a respected journalist, Alberta exposes the myriad ways the good news of Christ has been bent and perverted into a limited game of power politics. It was surprising to discover the depths of group think that has taken place as a cultic non-biblical dogmatism has arisen which has caused pastors to either conform to keep their attendance up or to take a courageous stand resulting in loss of attendance, insults and personal threats. Alberta, the Journalist, allows charlatan preachers to tell their own story. Alberta, the theologian, brings in relevant scripture passages that reveal the deception of their culture-bound preaching and teaching. The author demonstrates the damage to the church being done by political operatives. What appeared to be once healthy churches, now find their congregations either far from the Christian faith in a new and strange temporal political action committee type of community or decimated in both worship attendance and financial support as they seek to faithfully live into lives that mirror the life Jesus in our time. The first two parts of the book tell stories of the lurch to the political right taken by so many Evangelical Churches. The third part of the book tells the stories of those who are helping followers of Christ find new ways of biblical discipleship, peace-making, and community service. The Epilogue brings a message of hope and new pathways for understanding how the church can move forward. Don't miss this last part. It is likely the most important chapter in this book. A companion book or sequel could written that documents the influence of the political left on mainline churches. In any case, the issues of cultural influence on the church and the church as a cultural influence provides an endless field of inquiry as followers of Jesus seek ...to act justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with (their) God. Micah 6:8b",1 person found this helpful,"Jesus is Lord, not the grifters or America.","Alberta critiques the modern evangelical movement not just as a journalist observer, but as a lifelong believer that is horrified by what has become of the church in which he was molded. With measured humility, grace and a touch of righteous anger, he writes and calls to an American church that has lost its way and commission by not just mixing politics and faith, but conflating them altogether.

Dr. Devon Price has such a pleasant voice to listen to. They spoke plainly in a way I found easy to follow as they help the reader, or in our case the listener, understand autism better. In a gentle but firm and unwavering manner, Dr. Price tells the listener to throw out harmful neurotypical views on autism and instead listen to other autistic people. They remind the listener, or teach them, in my case, that too many neurotypical people place their own convenience or doxastic comfort above the happiness and healthiness of their neurodivergent counterparts. Or, to say it plainly: too many people insist on believing and enforcing the belief that there is a universal or even mandated Normal, that Normal is good and right, and that doing anything outside that Normal, even if it harms no one and makes the ‘abnormal’ person happy, is bad and wrong. Unmasking Autism is about rejecting the frivolous Normal and doing what makes you happy, as well as fighting for a world where everyone can do so. If you disagree with the belief that we should all fight for a world where everyone can unmask safely and happily, I beg you to listen to the WHOLE book before tossing it aside. Hold off your objections to whether anyone is being oppressed or wronged until you’ve listened to all Dr. Price has to say about how it actually feels to be an autist in a world that was not built for you, but rather was built to grind you into a palatable fraction of who you really are. Dr. Price’s intersectional perspective reminds them, and therefore allows them to remind us as the listeners, that autism (and indeed, life in general) does not look the same for everyone. They explain this with academic evidence as well as anecdotal stories shared with them from other neurodivergent people. There’s even a small but weighty and meaningful emphasis on how neurodivergence in different demographics is viewed by neurotypical society, and I appreciate that when they speak about the difficulties and even dangers of unmasking one’s autism when one is, say black, for instance, they use examples given to them by black autistic people. This book really opened up the door for me to question myself and the world I live in, and I truly believe I am better for it. It helped me learn to love a part of myself I and my family have been first ignorant and then resistant to for most of my life. I highly encourage everyone, regardless of whether or not you think you’re neurodivergent or know anyone who is, to read/listen to it. To that point, I want to recommend that you ignore, or at least set aside until you finish the book, any angry one star reviews complaining about how the book is too ‘woke’ or ‘indulgent in victim mentality’. It’s literally the author saying ‘hey autism and some other neurodivergent conditions aren’t something one needs to fix or hide in order to make neurotypical people happy, and we should fight for a world where no one is forced to do so.’ It’s about unabashedly being one’s autistic self. And yes, in order to achieve a world where people can be themselves happily and safely, a lot of social injustices must be corrected and left behind. This will always grind the gears of those unwilling to ask themselves whether they’re a part of the system that’s hurting others and whether they’re okay with that or not. Please, for yourself, and the rest of your teammates in this game of life, ie; literally everyone on the planet, PLEASE give this book a listen with an open mind and open heart. Also, the definition of doxastic is ‘of or pertaining to belief.’",2 people found this helpful,I used to think my mask protected me…,"""This book shifted my perspective on autism as well as myself.

Here are a few things worth highlighting: - offers great insights on how men and women's thought processes differ - helps identify areas where you may be misunderstanding your partner and making them wrong - for women: helps you find more effective ways to be assertive in your relationship and communicate what you want, while making your partner feel more appreciated and engaged with giving you what you need - for men: helps you provide the displays of caring your partner needs to feel good, while getting get the space you need in the relationship and not feeling misunderstood for wanting that - communication techniques can be applied in communicating with children, coworkers or anyone of the opposite gender - if you remember that the ultimate goal is to achieve harmony, love, acceptance and understanding of one another, then you will move beyond the datedness or hokey case studies and pull out the real gems here.",12 people found this helpful,Saved our relationship,"""This book truely saved our relationship at a time where both of us were very confused!

As a liberal arts major who dropped out of my first (and only) college physics class over 30 years ago, I found the information fascinating and the listen very enjoyable. It is done in chatty stories about not just the science, but the scientists. Who knew, for example, that Newton was apparently mad? And, it is not just for adults. My 13 year old son, who just started 7th grade, is also listening to the book, and he very much likes it -- my only concern is that he will know more than his teachers by the end of it; and somehow get into trouble. Oh well. The narrator is very good. Slight British accent is perfect, as the text has a few Bristish-isms which makes the whole more charming.

I am one of those people that only reviews items when I am truly blown away so let’s just dive on in. After reading this book I have got to say it is a compelling testament to Gabbard’s authentic dedication to serving her country. From beginning to end she speaks with a passionate narrative that delves into her journey from soldier to stateswoman, offering readers a glimpse into the inner workings of her mind and motivations. Her writing is driven by a deep sense of duty and a desire to make a meaningful impact on the world. She challenges readers to reconsider their perspectives on her and the broader political landscape. The book serves as a catalyst for introspection, prompting readers to question their own desires to become involved in the future of our country. Gabbard's sincerity shines through every page, leaving a lasting impression on those who seek a deeper understanding of her character and convictions. Whether you agree with her viewpoints or not, this book is an enlightening read that fosters empathy and encourages critical thinking. Gabbard's fearless approach to addressing controversial issues will undoubtedly leave readers inspired to engage more actively in the political discourse. In a world where authenticity is often elusive, Gabbard's unwavering commitment to her principles sets a powerful example for aspiring leaders everywhere. For Love of Country is not just a book; it's a call to action, challenging readers to become agents of positive change in their communities and beyond. I hope every single one of you that reads this book is struck with the same conviction I was. I’ve found the political spectrum to be very off putting in the recent past simply because of the totality of the landscape. To read this and get a deeper glimpse in to Gabbard’s foundation, why she is fighting her fight, and her vision of Americas future was simply outstanding. She speaks from the heart and it’s evident in every single page. The level of authenticity, vulnerability, and blunt force honesty is beyond refreshing and motivating. If you are thinking about purchasing this book I promise you won’t regret it, regardless of your political leaning.",5 people found this helpful,Must-read!!,"""Excellent description of the current state of the Democrat Party!

If you’ve been following his lectures on YouTube, you will hear many things in this book that you’ve heard before, and others you have not. I have only two criticisms; the first, and and the lesser of the two, is that he spends a bit too much time on some rather rambling personal stories for my taste. Peterson has so much to say of great importance, I find myself a bit bored with some of the extended stories of his growing up. The second criticism, the more substantial one, is that I would prefer he spend less time on the explanation of religious archetypes. While I find some of that interesting, I think it takes up too much of this book.

Odd that his disappointed detractors have never noticed that King's human villains have always reflected his keen awareness of how real evil plays out among the citizens of small town and rural America - we recognize them and have known them from our schooldays. His familiar bad guys are everyday bullies, abusers, hypocrites, haters, and random sociopaths writ large and monstrously scary. There used to be a sane consensus about those types, in real life as well as fantastic novels. The books work so well because King understands understands vice, and American-style vice particularly, in all of its moral and psychological awfulness. He also understands American goodness, in all of its stubborn, earnest sanity. And he understands what's going on today. It's in his books because writers are culturally engaged, even when they seem or pretend not to be - literacy 101. And it's odd that the complainers are so exercised about Holly, anyway - the villains aren't even vicious sheriffs or lunatic clergy or woman-bullyers (plenty of those traditionally right wing bad guys in his works). Just some perverse old academics genially going about their evil versus a modest, luminously decent, politically temperate woman investigator, in a pandemic-exhausted, half-lunatic, Trumpy world that King could have written himself. Same as the one we're all trying to survive. And as always, it's delicious, creepy fun.",41 people found this helpful,Perfect narrator,"""I have six hours left. But I wanted to say a few things.

They all had their own unique personalities and struggles and the story gave just enough time to each of them, as well as a nice sprinkling of other tertiary (but still compelling) characters. It provided a good mix of character development and murder plotting, which is hard to find in modern murder mystery/crime stories. I also loved that the book gave us a solid introduction to McMasters and then changed pace to focus on the “theses” of these three characters. In the end, the book allows us to relish a bit in the satisfaction of sweet revenge while tempering that out with the consequences of taking another human life. I was very happy with the way the story concluded.

It's just been done too many times. If you're going to do something that's been done over and over again, you need to bring something new to the table. Unfortunately, this wasn't anything I haven't read before, and the villain's motives were really far fetched. Too formulaic...it felt like an episode of NCIS. I knew two of the twists about Anonymous' identity almost immediately, but it's through process of elimination, because this was so formulaic, I identified the red herrings immediately & knew they weren't the villain just bc the suspicion was thrown onto them too obviously. I didn't get it all right, but enough of it to be annoyed by the predictably. The parts I didn't get right were only impossible bc there was some sudden information thrown in at the end that was unknowable & further, some of it was just so far-fetched and bizarre that you couldn't have guessed. That's not what a twist should be. Too many authors are falling into this trap of writing the story around the twist to the point where the twist isn't even fun. I gave 3 starts bc the performance was great, and the author's writing style is good enough that it held my attention, which is one of the biggest factors in my enjoyment of a book, but if you've heard even a few of the one ppl disappearing at a time and the killer is among us tropes, this one will probably not be anything you haven't heard.",,,,,,,,

This book gets a lot of varying reviews, but i believe that’s because lots of people don’t exactly know what they’re getting into. Without spoilers I intend to lay that out for you here. First and foremost, this book is not either of the movies. Much like The Lord Of The Rings, or the Harry Potters, while the movies are inspired greatly from the books, they also are forced to leave a great deal out and rewrite areas as that the viewing experience can be more palatable. You need to go into this book remembering that, and you may just have a great time. Secondly, this is a Stephen King novel and that means something different than first time readers may expect. Stephen King in excellent at building a world. As with any book he has written you can practically see, feel, and come to love the world he has made. For the world to feel realistic it has to act realistic. Halfof this story is set in 1958, so people have to talk like it’s 1958, kids have to act like it’s 1958, and the world must react like it’s 1958. It’s not pretty. Some parts of it are really terrible. That’s what King’s horror is. His horror is not the foremost part of his novels, horror is just what you feel once you become fully immersed within his world right as he begins to tear it down. Thirdly the narration is an acting narration. Every character has a different voice with a different accent with stutters and yells and whispers. It’s not for everyone. Imagine it like listening to a movie playing in the other room, that’s what this entire book is like. Finally this book is 44 hours long. Not everyone gets that at first. Both IT movies combined are 5 1/2 hours long, so things move much slower in the book. If you were to listen to this book for eight hours a day everyday, it would take just under a week to finish. Listening to IT for three hours a day would take half a month to finish. Think about that commitment before you buy this book. This book isn’t for everyone. It’s harsh, it’s cruel, and it’s horrifying in ways you wouldn’t expect. But it’s also a really good book.",10 people found this helpful,Weber’s performance is just ... Wow,"""King’s “It” needs no plug from me. It’s a classic, not my first read, won’t be my last. But, I had to pop in and express my admiration for Steven Weber. His narration was brilliant. It’s as close to a perfect performance as I’ve ever had the pleasure of experiencing. His voices were so —real—. Pennywise was THE Pennywise, sardonic and cruel, the voice of deranged evil. I lost myself in the story—a story I’ve known a while—like I was experiencing it for the first time. Mr. Weber, I know you’ll never see this, but I am a convert. I’ll soon own all the books you’ve narrated.",4 people found this helpful,Great story and performance!,absolutely loved this book. great story telling and detail. the only downside was the occasional cuts in the audio where a word or two was missing at the end of a couple chapters.,2 people found this helpful,,,,,,,

Does It Hurt?,"Mystery, Thriller & Suspense",H. D. Carlton,Troy Duran,,12,7,3/20/2023,24.95,1900,4.4,4.7,4.4,1232,388,173,66,41,1420,210,74,19,17,1104,350,170,64,52,This is a tough one,"I really wanted to like this story. I know it's billed as dark, so as with the last dark romance I listened to, it's on me for continuing to listen in spite of the distaste I felt. Dark romance is certainly not something I regularly seek out, but I love Troy Duran's work, so I try to listen to one of his books that is completely out of my comfort zone every so often. His narration and Michelle Sparks', who is new to me, performance are truly flawless, and are the ONLY thing that made me see this one through. Troy's mastery of accents is amazing -- the Italian, oh my, and I loved Michelle's Australian accent, too! I know sex sells, but there is such a thing as overkill, and this book definitely fits that bill; and how on earth two people can be continually attracted to one another when they have a bone-deep hatred and are terribly mean to each other, is beyond me. Sexual tension or not, two broken, messed up souls or not, you can't tell me such attraction can realistically be sustained long term, let alone lead to love. Yes, I know this is fiction, and perhaps the goal is to allow readers/listeners to live vicariously through the characters to experience something they otherwise wouldn't, but good grief, there is more to life than sex. What could have been a much better story, given the mystery surrounding the lighthouse and Sylvester's creepiness, was swallowed up in one meaningless sex scene after another. Even after all that happened and the unique, heartfelt way Sawyer was able to put her past behind her in the end, I felt nothing, no connection to these characters, and that is a big must for me with any book, connection. The tender moments between Enzo and Sawyer that are supposed to make us believe they have truly fallen in love, rang completely hollow. Authors of dark romance, this author included, need to understand that when it comes to the spice factor, less is often more, otherwise even the most avid fans could become tired and disillusioned.",27 people found this helpful,Wowzers!,"""Okay these Narrators were amazing. Enzo’s voice was so freaking sexy, it was hard to pay attention! Haha jk! This book was insanity, from the first shark encounter to the last, it was definitely a wild ride. Sawyer and Enzo were made for each other and I could not get enough of them! This book was sinister and dark but also beautiful and exhilarating! The twists and turns made this book everything. We meet Sawyer, a young girl on the run from her past, she been playing people for the last 6 years to survive! But she plays the wrong person and he comes after her! Enzo is a dark brooding guy who has been hurt in the past and when these collide you know it’s going to be anything but dangerous! After realizing what Sawyer took from him he hunts her down and takes her out for boat ride, the boat ride turns into a nightmare as a storm tosses them overboard and they have to fight to stay alive in the deadly sea! They wash ashore on a deserted lighthouse, but it’s not actually deserted. And old man named Sylvester resides on the island and he takes care of the abandoned lighthouse. After a few weeks staying with him strange things start to happen and Sawyer and Enzo realize they have to put their hatred for each other aside and work together! This was an intense book I would highly recommend checking trigger warnings!",3 people found this helpful,11/10,Remove any expectations from the cat & mouse duet and you will love this if you like HD Carlton's writing!!

Have been patiently waiting for her next spellbinding thriller. Never disappointed until The Witch Elm which was very slow in developing but still a remarkable whodunnit. With The Searcher, the author has left the typical scene of crime novels. The book is beautifully written - especially when you're looking for a description of rural Ireland far from the beaten tourist track. It still exists. I lived there for almost 20 years in the countryside, yet not as remote as the place she creates somewhere in the northwest. We were blow-ins like the hero, Cal, who retires to peace and quiet, renovating an old cottage. We bought a working farm and encountered the same characters French creates in this book. The townland and its squinting windows seem eerily familiar, the suspicion of the locals towards any outsider, their testing of the blow-ins sense of humor by incessant slagging and their stamina: How long will they last? I loved hearing the Irish voices and expression again. Roger Clark does a very good job imitating that. Not sure about the slow, American drawl that's bordering on boring. I wonder how many non-Irish English speakers understand How's she cuttin...? On the other hand, I 'm surprised she didn't use the word boreen as an apt name for the part of that townland Cal was in. The lengthy descriptions about the Irish rain, sky, wind ,and dullness of the countryside in the winter take me right back to my own experience and are comparable to mine. I once had a Farm in Ireland, Nothing much has changed since.( Situation of bachelor farmers left behind on the land while young women or more energetic types who don't inherit the farm move to Dublin or emigrate. Even the matchmaking attempts ring true. I was a matchmaker there for 4 years. (Next Time Lucky). The storyline is so slow in developing- just like The Witch Elm that after 10 hours of listening or 18 chapters I still wasn't sure there was a plot or crime at all. Without giving too much away, the really exciting, hair-raising part of the whole story happens in the last hour. And the chapters as well as hours leading up to that are not a tightly woven psychological thriller, but as I said before a true depiction of rural, remote Ireland as it still exists. I persevered because I loved that detailed description that woke memories in me, not because of its nail-biting plot. Roger Clark's voice had the soothing side effect of sending me to sleep which was quite welcome. I agree with another review that suggested Tana French should have stuck to her Dublin Murder Squad of the first books at which she excelled!",8 people found this helpful,Disappointed,"""This was not like the other Tana French books I've read.

Her brother Shep and his best friend Anson, who is very grumpy and a loner, is going to help rebuild her old family house for her.  She is at the house when she meets Anson and they don’t know each other and have a “not so friendly” first meeting.  Anson has a lot of things from his past that he is keeping hidden from everyone, except for Shep since he has known him for a long time.  Things start happening around Rhodes, and Anson is always by her side to help her out.  As always in Catherine’s stories, the suspense picks up and we have to start to figure out who is involved in everything going on.  This mystery had a lot to think about, and I didn’t figure this one out.  I loved how Anson and Rhodes got closer and eventually shared their past with each other.  They were so sweet and loving to each other and were such a great couple together.  The other characters in this series were great and I can’t wait to hear all their stories.  I loved that Rhodes fostered animals and I especially adored her dog biscuit.  I found myself laughing out loud at times in this story, especially with Grandma’s flowers!  The narration was fantastic!  Andi and Zachary were perfection bringing out all of the emotion and grumpiness and sunshine of Anson and Rhodes.  They made the story very enjoyable to listen to.",,,,,,,,

They feed off of each other magnificently and like the talented performers that they are they knew how to play to their strengths and keep up the interest where otherwise the action would have stalled. Maxine is a complete and utter rock star carrying much of the narrative but giving this 19yr old girl some grit and nuances that made her more interesting. Cecilia is on this journey to self discovery and Maxine gave her the voice of strength that I needed to hear so she didn't seem whiney or a complete hot mess. Joe Arden, I can only imagine, was having a ball playing a wide variety of male characters and giving each one depth, personality and interesting quirks.

Half memoir, half writing “how to,” it is absorbing and delightful. I recommend it to my students and suggest that they read it every year. However, that is the only one of King’s books that I’ve been able to read. I’ve tried many times, but kept getting bogged down after 20 or 30 pages. The stories were okay, but couldn’t hold my interest because the writing seemed too heavy handed, brutish, like he was typing with his fists. So, after days of consideration, it was with great reluctance that I downloaded 11/22/63. The reviews were good, glowing, in fact, and I’ve learned to trust the opinions of Audible listeners. Plus, the book is more than 30 hours long, which the bargain hunter in me always finds attractive. I just finished it tonight. It is a wonderful and fascinating story, based loosely on an English teacher’s obsession with Lee Harvey Oswald and the possibility of going back in time to prevent the Kennedy killing. I also enjoyed the love story, which the author handles with charm, humor and honesty. The writing is wonderful, masterful, vivid, compelling. The characters are rich and deep, genuine, involved, and I find myself thinking about them and their lives often throughout the day. Life in small-town and big-town 1958 up to 1963 is mesmerizing, much as I remember it, with the constant but subtle hint of mysterious dangers to come. You’ll get no more details from me, only a hearty endorsement. Well worth every minute, made doubly valuable by the excellent and interesting reading by Craig Wasson. Totally believable, wonderfully surprising, and, well, I was going to say something about the ending, but you'll want to find that out for yourself.",770 people found this helpful,Interjections of pesonal politics... blah,"""I may have underrated this title's story rating, as I couldn't delineate King's political sentiments bleeding through the pages and the incredible story. Normally I don't have a problem with authors' personal beliefs as the stories they write are a reflection of who they are, however this one is different. King asserts that the assassination of JFK, portrayed as just shy of deity, resulted in the escalation of Vietnam, MLK's assassination, and a really big stretch to GW Bush becoming president. If he can stop that assassination the entirety of the current world problems never would have come to fruition and our present world would be a utopia thanks to JFK's completed tenure and the resultant butterfly affect. To be fair, this is my first King Novel. I absoluteness loved it. The detail, the imagination, the heartbreak with the obdurate past, had me emotionally tied to saving JFK as well, but King's cri de couer over JFK's death really tarnishes the novel. ****SPOILER ALERT**** The end of the book is where I really had the biggest problem. The entire story is about the butterfly affect i.e., how an action ripples through time and affects something else but really only observable through comparable time travel. King's afterword concedes that he wants to display the worst possible scenario if JFK survives 11-22-63, in order assuage liberal minded peoples' love affair with Kennedy's death. Within 24 hours a sizable earthquake occurs (directly related to Kennedy surviving the assassination attempt), intense seismic activity continues for decades, yet, somehow Bill Clinton still marries Hillary, he still runs for office but dies before he can take office, so Hillary becomes president. I don't know how King reconciles the intensity of the butterfly affect with major seismic activity but other things remain completely unchanged. There are a few other examples of either blatant laziness by the author, or intentional political purveyance. Although his examples are bias, his analogy of a harmonizing effect of the different time strings is insightful. Definitely worth your time, but be prepared to roll your eyes if you don't subscribe 100% to a liberal political leaning.",56 people found this helpful,'Who's the Lovin' Daddy'...Cue the Band!,"You'd think after 50 novels even a distinguished author would be creatively wrung out, cranking out literary Pablum, possibly living comfortably off the body of works from Ago, but no no no...King has somehow evolved--(indentured soul to the devil in trade??). Not only is his writing still inventive and original, it is insightful, intelligent, and intimate, and as is true with the best of the best of them, it reflects true dedication and respect to the art of writing, it is masterful. King's trend away from boogey men (never boogie men--SK likes his tunes) toward the monsters within, is obvious with 11-22-63, and should once and for all show how adeptly King can stand proudly among giants, both literary main stream genre giants and the one-eyed-one-horned slimy kind. Surprisingly, the story is not as focused on the alternate history as it is on an alternate universe, and about what King does best, the story of people in extraordinary circumstances--missed opportunities, what-if's, hopes, dreams, good guys and very bad guys. It's familiar in many ways, even comfortable, loaded with heart and soul, maybe a little sap, and just when you reach for the tissue--out pops evil incarnate (ala Hitchcock-- via Derry, Pennywise, Christine, Lee Harvey, etc.) just to remind you...it is, after all, King, Stephen King. And, if familiar with King, you know it's long (let's not hear anymore about editing), you know it's entertaining, but you may be surprised by the polish and maturity. I've read some critiques that say this is the book King was born to write. Personally, I wouldn't limit such a talented and prolific writer with that kind of statement! Highly recommend; big claps for the meticulous research; kudos for time traveling with flair-not cheese. The narration is outstanding, absolutely equal to the work it performs and should be considered the high mark in audio performance. Could not get better. * If you've read the book or the reviews, how's this for an eerie harmonious coincidence?: I just happened to also be reading Chris Matthew's Jack Kennedy: Elusive Hero, (which I also highly recommend) *shiver moment* and find the research in both books praiseworthy.",41 people found this helpful,,,,,,,

The character development, interpersonal relationships and plot line were incredibly well done. I love the characters and find myself attached to them after this second book. I’ve read all of Tana French and she truly is the best of the best. This series is different from her usual in that they are not overwhelmingly tragic, and the main characters are wholesome and likable. Don’t get me wrong I’ve loved all of her darker novels and twisted characters as well, but it’s refreshing to have something lighter, although I find myself worrying about the characters knowing what French is capable of ??. Feeling more reassured despite some hardships, this series is as close to finding a happy ending as we’re going to get with her. In a day where it seems everyone and their mother can publish a book, great authors like French stand apart. If you need action on every page or detailed sex senes to hold your attention, however, this may not be the read for you. The story is of a retired Chicago cop who moves to a small town in Ireland. There is a lot of silence within -- between people giving each other emotional space, between family members pondering the future, between neighbors stewing about the past. We met Cal, the cop, in the first book where he begins mentoring teenage Trey whose family is a train wreck. Her grifter dad had split and her older brother had disappeared. Trey is a young woman of few words but she doesn't miss much. Cal and his girlfriend Lena represent the only stability and structure in Trey's life. When Trey's con man daddy Johnny reappears, it sets in motion a disastrous chain of events. The beauty of this book is the wonderful characterizations, sparsely yet completely drawn. Cal is a good man but he has no illusions, particularly about Johnny, who is just like every loser Cal encountered in his long law enforcement career. Trey has become like another daughter to Cal and he will do anything to protect her. But Trey doesn't particularly want to be sheltered and is feisty and independent. And she has an agenda of her own.",4 people found this helpful,Best sequel ever!,"""Tana French nails this sequel…. and Roger Clark nails the narration. That’s all that needs to be said for anyone remotely interested in this superb story.",4 people found this helpful,Beautifully written and Narrated,The characters are so well fleshed out and likable - in a raw way - that I want to meet them again in another book.

Characters are absolutely loveable. They are dynamic and constantly growing and changing but the writer does a fantastic job of retaining who the characters are at their core through the book while still allowing them to grow and learn. The voice acting by Jeff Hays is amazing, every character is giving a unique and memorable voice, accent, and inflection. From the goblins roaming the halls of floor one to Carl himself, this man does a fantastic job of bringing all the characters to life in a way that made me really invested each time I started up the audio book. Overall, Dungeon Crawler Carl is a unique and absolutely fantastic book with a compelling narrative that will leave you wanting more. Good thing I get to move on to the second book, because the, I wish it wasn't over feeling is deep for this book.",5 people found this helpful,,,,,,,

I like the historic angle and as always I like how he has no problems in showing how even now in the 21st century narrow minded people holds on to archaic prejudices in regards of race. Some characters names are a bit confusing because they are the same as some who have passed. You definitely need to be fully awake.

From what I've listened to so far the narrator (Grover Gardner) does a great job! He pulled me into the story with no distracting affectation that you get from so many other recorded books of the horror/fantasy genre. However, the daunting 48 hour listen may have me augmenting the audio edition with my paperback. What other book might you compare The Stand to and why? Grant's Pass - by Amanda PIller. A post-apocalyptic anthology, well written and very fun to read. At times I felt that this collection was the 'lost chapters' of The Stand. Swan's Song - A very good read in the same vein, Robert McGammon is another of my favorites (unrelated but other great books by him: Boy's Life and Going South) The Road - by Cormac McCarthy. Grittier and darker than The Stand but evocative (the book is better than the movie and I liked the movie) Which scene was your favorite? Gosh, so many! - the tunnel, the...hey, I'm not gonna spoil this for first timers! Read it and love it! Once everyone is up to speed, I may update this. Any additional comments? To all those folks who won't read this just because it's by Stephen King - please do yourself a favor and get this book. Although is has some 'horrific' scenes, the character development and story arc are some of the best I've ever read. Don't be put off by his reputation as Master of Horror - he's also a Master Storyteller; remember, this is the same author who gave us Stand By Me and The Shawshank Redemption.

I listen mainly on the way too and from work. This took almost two months to finish. There were times that I was ready for it to be over.. but then something so poignant and superbly written would be read by Grover Gardner and I was in love with the book all over again. I know that King wanted this to be his Lord of the Rings, his epic tale of the fight between good and evil and it was thrilling and gripping and left me laughing and smiling and loving the characters. I loved how well Grover Gardner narrated the different voices for the characters. He truly is one of the best out there. And every time Tom Cullens says, Laws yes, I had to smile. Fantastic book. Don't give up on it- go on the journey, you won't regret it!",207 people found this helpful,A Biblical USA Post-Apocalypse Lord of the Rings,"Stephen King's The Stand (1978/90) was an epic (48 hour!) listen. It's an ambitious novel, a hybrid of post-apocalypse sf like Alas Babylon, epic fantasy like The Lord of the Rings, horror movies like Nightmare on Elm St., and Biblical stories like The Book of Job, all set in a sea of American popular culture. People who like those genres (and don't mind profanity, sex, violence, and many hours of listening) would like the novel. The first part depicts the devastating outbreak of a military plague, the second shows the shocked survivors forming groups around two figures seen in dreams, and the third shows the climactic last stand (for now). King writes a suspenseful plot about human and changing characters. At times Frannie is too teary and Glen too much of a Heinlein know-it-all, but I love the sweet, mentally retarded Tom, the deaf and dumb leader Nick, and the Gary Cooper-esque Texan Stu. The Trashcan Man, Harold, and Nadine are morbidly fascinating, while Randall Flagg (aka the dark man, Satan's servant, etc.) is a charismatic supernatural antagonist. Listening to the novel etched many scenes on my imagination, among them Larry and Rita going through the Lincoln Tunnel, Nick and Tom hiding from a tornado, Joe playing the guitar by a fire, Mother Abigail presiding over a feast, the Kid and the Trashcan Man driving towards Vegas, Harold holding a walkie-talkie at dusk, Flagg interviewing Dana, and Larry, Ralph, and Glen doing a very difficult thing at a washout gully, and Tom, Stu, and Kojak sharing Christmas. Grover Gardner dexterously reads the voices of the many different characters (old and young, male and female, all from different educational, economic, and regional backgrounds) with skill, emotion, and wit. Hearing his Trashcan Man groan to the dark man, My life for you, or his Kid say, You believe that, happy crappy? or his Tom say, M-O-O-N--that spells tired etc., or his Flagg croon, I love to love Nadine, made me walk around imitating them. I can hear them now. Sometimes King overuses certain phrases (as when like a one legged man in an ass-kicking contest pops up twice), or his characters' expressions don't ring true (as when Frannie writes that Harold is a real boogersnot), or he tosses in one too many popular culture references (as when some tires are as bald as Telly Savalas). But I usually found his style vivid and page turning, and at times funny, scary, or moving. I dislike The Stand's cheap association of wolves, weasels, and crows with evil and its moving some of the responsibility for evil away from human beings and towards the devil, but I like its questioning of whether we can escape our fatal tendency towards too much organization, rationality, and technology in favor of free, irrational, and green alternatives: as Stu asks Frannie, Do you think people ever learn anything? and Frannie answers, I don't know.",15 people found this helpful,,,,,,,

I waited a week or so before starting this book and right away, I could tell this was different. It almost seemed like a ‘normal’ book, full of ‘normal’ characters, with barely an inkling of horror. Yet it was honest and compelling and I couldn’t stop listening. It wasn’t until we were well into the book that we began to delve into some of King’s usual genre, yet even then it was subdued, without losing its interest or edge.

I pre-order everything she writes with zero doubt as to whether it will be a good read or a dud. She comes through every time. And this book is no exception. I’ve had its release date plugged into my phone’s calendar for months and stopped reading another book right smack in the middle of its riveting story the day *this* book was released because I just couldn’t wait any longer. Anyway, bottom line is that I absolutely loved it. It veered off course slightly from her other books, but in a good way as it mixed in bits and pieces of “podcast” material. And honestly, I suspect many other audiobooks will follow suit in the future with highly stylized productions that include lots of background sound bites to further enhance the plot and character development. Very saturated listen. And speaking of the listening, the narration was superb. My only criticism is that on a few occasions, the voice of a male interviewer is nearly impossible to make out as it’s been purposefully quieted to mimic the style of a true crime podcast where only the interviewee is wearing a mic and everything else fades into the background. The plot is perfectly twisty-turny, but it’s the character development that really knocks it out of the park. Lisa has mastered the art of unspooling her characters in a way draws the reader in so closely that when the book is over, you find yourself wondering what the characters are up to…thinking of them more like people who exist in the real world rather than fictional entities. An exquisite read. 10/10 recommend.",8 people found this helpful,Such a feeling of dread throughout- SO GOOD,"""I LOVED this book. The characters are so complex and you spend a lot of the first half trying to piece together what you think is going on. Such amazing story telling and the performances were incredible.

Even my husband who is not a reader was hanging around me and when I asked what he was doing, he said he wanted to know what was going to happen next and he was hooked too! My only complaint was the last couple chapters were kinda dull. Since the rest of the book was so full of twists and turns, I was expecting something to pop out toward the end too.

I was expecting so much more with how much I’ve heard about this duet, but I just felt underwhelmed by it all. While it handles some darker themes I guess I was just expecting it to be darker as far as the romance. To me, the darker elements are what the hero was handling on the side, taking down a child trafficking type ring. The romance was just kind of lacking. The hero is walking by a bookstore one day and sees a poster in the window of the heroine’s face, she’s an author and there there that day for a book event. He is instantly drawn to her just from the photo and wants her for his. He starts stalking her. She’s living in her late grandmother’s house and starts going through her great grandmother’s diary, which leads to a murder mystery from the 1940s where her great grandmother had her own complex relationship with a stalker. Honestly those excerpts were the most interesting part of the book for me. ?? I never felt the romance between the hero and the heroine, he just wanted her and she enjoyed and got off on the fear. And he’s sort of like a vigilante doing good by taking down terrible people. I don’t know, it was fine.

As for the narration, it is nice to hear the author read his own story. However, he is not a professional narrator and while J.D.'s voice is fine, it did not enhance the story.

Fake baritone voiced Elizabeth Holmes and her cruel boyfriend Ramesh Sunny Balwani held them tightly in mortal fear, pursuing the few who thought they could resign and rebuild their lives. No lab employee could be allowed to expose the fraud. The multi-billion dollar secret at the time: Theranos was phony baloney; it had no device that could run all types of blood tests with just a drop of blood and then provide instant accurate test results. It didn't have anything to change the world. All those Theranos devices being used by the U.S. military in Afghanistan - pure fabrication. But nobody could prove it wasn't being done and besides, the board of directors included: George Shultz; James Mattis; Henry Kissinger; and many other famous heavy hitters. The suspense built and built. Author and narrator matched up nicely, building strength as the book progressed. They made me feel the fear a Theranos lab technician who had to pretend miracles happened. One former lab director was driven to suicide, a mere pawn in this game. Former lab employees discovered the hard way they could run but not hide (those who tried to hide were found by Theranos investigators). George Shultz's grandson was caught more than once trying flip his grandfather, and his family was made to spend an obscene amount (I think it was $400K) trying to defend against Theranos lawsuits. Legal bills were only part of the harassment. Holmes and her crew ruined people's reputations and careers. Elizabeth Holmes remains a mystery. Carreyrou says she was an outstanding sales person. She relieved big money out of sophisticated investors - $150 million from the Walton family, $121 million from Rupurt Murdoch, $100 million from Betsy DeVos (her father-in-law was co-founder of Amway), $120 million from the Cox family that controls Cox Media Group, and so on. Bad Blood shows how an apex con artist dupes important people by appealing to ego and greed. Jim Cramer said her company was changing healthcare the same way Amazon changed retail. President Clinton publicly asked her for advice on reducing inequality. She made the Time Magazine 100 List. She talked pure nonsense without interviewers being aware of it. Instead they probably saw a female Steve Jobs; we all wanted to see a female Steve Jobs. Although it tries, the book doesn't explain what Holmes said and did behind closed doors that captured sophisticated investors and government leaders. It's still a mystery. I keep thinking about it. In retrospect, all those employees who lived in fear were never the target. Holmes targeted billionaires, and to a lesser extent, famous people with big egos. Holmes dealt with these people directly. She made them wait; she made sure her security detail was more numerous than theirs; she decided when the meeting was over; she put the pants on them and dipped them. How on earth did she pull it all off? True crime is an exciting genre, and this book succeeds for two reasons: 1. The author was part of the story from the beginning, as he understood a crime was occurring and the villain worked at shutting him up. 2. The story was told from the perspective of lab employees living the nightmare of running from a monster that gives pursuit. (Separately, I keep thinking about the non-disclosure agreement (NDA) Theranos used on employees, how they weaponized this basic legal contract. One can imagine why lab scientists and technicians signed since this was a condition of employment.)",172 people found this helpful,Thank the gods for real journalism in this era,"""The narration was spot on and Carreyrou kept me hooked for days. Do not skip this one. There was an amazing passage in this book that could've been talking about anyone from the current administration. Unsurprisingly, many conservatives directly involved in the Trump administration had joined this cult of greed and lies then helped to prop up this destructive farce. I can't call it a company because it clearly was a criminal organization. Jim Mattis's actions are especially disgusting. He was all to happy to use our troops as guinea pigs for untested medical devices because he sat on the board and directly stood to profit. Don't worry though, there were a couple Dems in there now and again. The scariest thing about this book is that the very important agencies and regulatory bodies may never have stepped in if it wasn't for the bravery of a few former employees and John Carreyrou's willingness to call BS. So many people knew from the beginning how dangerous this technology was and what a scam they were running, yet lawyers managed to terrify them all into submission. The Theranos scam is a result of the complete erosion of rights for employees, patients, and consumers and the rise of the silicone valley cult of greed (with a lot of help from our corporate politicians.) Journalists are our last and best hope and despite my depression at the state of our nation, this is one of the few bright lights.

I wish there wasn’t so much focus on race especially in the beginning. I totally understand the hardships of woman and woman of color but there were parts of it that as a “white” woman made me feel like I shouldn’t be listening to it bc I wasn’t a woman of color. Both of my boys are biracial and so many of my clients/family/friends are as well. I want so badly to recommend this book because there is so much value in it but the beginning talks so much about race and “white” men etc. I get it girl, I do but So many business men/woman no matter what race especially your younger genderation will listen and check out pretty quickly based on that alone. Maybe they don’t deal with corporate America but are still striving to be successful. It only will you lose them in the beginning of the book but think about all the referrals you could lose. I wanted to send this to all the woman at my shop but I know some of the younger girls will listen to the first few chapters and check out bc they won’t be able to relate. I took so many helpful things away from your book but there were a few times I felt uncomfortable as a white woman reading it like the information wasn’t meant for woman like me. I hope that makes sense. Nothing about my review is meant to be rude or take away from anything. I took so much useful information away from it! But there are certain people I wouldn’t recommend it too and I feel like that’s money and information on the table you may lose.",1 person found this helpful,ultra motivating down to earth empowering read,100% loved it. life changing perspectives and modern vibes.

I'll be reading this at least once a year from now on and being sure to take action.",19 people found this helpful,The 1 book you need for marketing a small business,"I've gone through eight books related to marketing, six of which were focused on small businesses. This book is the most useful of all of them. It gives you the complete picture of how to do direct response marketing, and the overall reasoning behind the process. The book makes this point, but I'll emphasis it... this isn't something you can just sit down and listen to. You really do need to think about how these concepts apply to your business, and how you will leverage them. Also, I'm sure many people will stop listening because they feel like they already know some aspect of this stuff, and not get the full value out of understanding how the entire thing works together. The book tries to get you to make a 1-page plan, but if you're like me, you'll wind up with way more notes on how to do marketing than 1 page. Though, the book does talk about the 80/20 rule (20% of effort gets 80% of results), so if all you get from this is a 1 page plan, that's probably just fine! Another book worth mentioning is Radical Relevance, as it helps hammer home a critical portion covered in The 1-Page Marketing Plan. Building a StoryBrand is another good book. I think both of these are actually mentioned in The 1-Page Marketing Plan. Russell Brunson has a trilogy of marketing books that are covering direct response marketing, but I think they will be more uniquely relevant to specific types of small businesses. How to Create a Perfect Landing Page is also okay, if you're looking for more specifics on that aspect of the direct response marketing approach.",3 people found this helpful,,,,,,,

I tend to read and trust reviews prior to purchasing and some of the negative reviews made me a bit hesitant, as I considered them valid points, based on the opinions of people I know who’ve read it. I will say, I am grateful that my curiosity about this book was overwhelming enough to make me check it out anyway. It is very “The Secret-ish” but depending on what your relationship with money is, that can be REALLY helpful. My relationship with money feels more spiritual than anything and my attitude about it was once very negative. This book really helped me realize that. Your subconscious really can affect the way you behave. A negative subconscious and lead to negative behaviors and attitudes. And wether you get rich or not, have negative feelings toward anything is unhealthy and tends to breed more negativity. If you’re looking for a “How To Get Rich...” book, this book isn’t for you. But if you could use a much more positive attitude toward money and money related matters, READ IT!",8 people found this helpful,My Daughter and I love the bad ass series,"let me preface this by saying I really love these books and how down to earth Jen is... BUT... My only complaint of the entire series I have heard so far is the pronunciation of the word ET cetera as EK cetera, it leaves this picky pronuncier (is there such a word?) feeling ragged every time I hear it, which is PLENTY in these books. I mean it is spelled et-cetera, and abbreviated as ETC. not (ect.) just watch the old movie The King and I and see the king learn what etcetera means and how to say it, that's where I learned it at 5 years old.

All he can do is to tell you about his own experiences. To be frank, the central idea given in this book (the Fastlane) is not for everyone, including me. Why?

Most businesses operate on thin margins, especially with physical products. So $1M in sales === ~ $40k in earnings. Of course the real payout is if you can sell the business in 24-36 months for real capital. You will still need to work about 3000-4000 hours a year. But most business owners do that anyway.

These days, similar exposure can be achieved by buying an index fund, a point Ben Zweig mentions in his commentary.

However, for those who can absorb and apply business information quickly, the make pretend story this book keeps bouncing back to about Sarah and her pie shop is trying too hard to be a novel and steals hours of your life. At least half of this book is told as a parable to offer an application example, which isn't a bad idea... Gerber is no Hemingway though and he's apparently unaware of this. In the very beginning when he starts describing the haze of flour in the air being struck my sunlight you know you're in for a long ride. He's a slow and methodical reader which doesn't help either.

I started with the Audible version, and Gary’s engaging narration immediately pulled me in. His energy and passion are contagious, making the experience both educational and entertaining. What makes this audiobook truly special are the moments when Gary goes off script. His breakout comments, personal anecdotes, and additional insights are the true gems. These off-the-cuff remarks add layers of understanding and context that you won't find in the written text, making the Audible experience incredibly enriching. Gary frequently reminds listeners to get the physical book, and at first, I found this amusing. But I quickly realized how practical this advice is. Switching back and forth between Audible and the enhanced features can be a bit challenging, so having the hard copy is a game-changer. I ended up ordering the physical book, and it now sits on my office desk as a crucial resource. The insights in Day Trading Attention are invaluable. Gary emphasizes that social algorithms now prioritize interests over people, highlighting the importance of creating valuable, relevant content. His advice on mastering either short or long-form content has been particularly useful, helping me better engage with my audience. This book isn't just about social media; it covers a wide range of topics including influencer marketing, paid media advertising, and building a community around your brand. Gary’s strategies for leveraging modern attention channels have already had a significant impact on my approach to content creation and audience engagement. I’ve read the hard copy once and am gearing up for a second, more detailed read-through. This time, I plan to mark up the pages and treat it like a textbook, extracting every bit of wisdom it offers. If you’re serious about mastering the art and science of storytelling in today’s digital age, Day Trading Attention is essential. I highly recommend buying both the Audible and the physical book. They provide different experiences that complement each other perfectly.

With everything that happens, what an improvement Lysander's VA from Dark Age would have made this. Honestly it would have made this near perfect. it would be all the more immersive.

I was very critical of the VO during the first few hours of the story. I even swore in my initial review that I wouldn't complete the book. I was wrong. This book was incredible. Yes, the VO is not without it's flaws. TGR is the best in the business in my opinion. The best. For whatever reason, whether it be by choice or something else, the first five or so hours of the VO are off. It's possible it was by choice. Maybe TGR felt Darrow needed to sound exhausted, sick, injured. But it was a hard listen at first. And at times it was hard to decipher between Darrow and Lysander. But about six hours in, TGR slid into all the characters perfectly. Proving why he is the best and affirming Pierce's decision to hire only him. It's a brilliant book. As good as the first three. Truly. Stick through the rocky beginning. It's worth it.",3 people found this helpful,,,,,,,

However, I do have some tips for you if you’re listening rather then reading it. The actually hard copy book comes with a map so it’s fun to be reading and flip back and forth between the pages and map to see where he’s describing. Obviously that’s more difficult if you’re listening to it. I would recommend looking a map up on your phone or online of Beleriand and when he starts describing a place to go look for it. It makes the read more enjoyable and you’re not just over whelmed by these random places. My other tip is if you’re wondering who someone is, then look them up online, because the further the story goes it’s cool to see who’s connected to who. Overall, in the end once we get to the third age it’s sweet to see who Elrond comes from and it makes you realize how old Galadriel and Cirdan actually are, and what they’ve both been through. It’s freaking awesome! Also, Andy’s performance was was great as usual! Hope this helps",50 people found this helpful,"Masterpiece, an Oscar Worthy Performance","""I have been through 50+ audiobooks at this point and this is far and away the best, by a wide margin. Andy Serkis lends himself to every single character, perspective, and simply master the poetic nature of the story better than anyone before. This is a man all time performance of an otherwise difficult or inaccessible piece of fantasy told at the level and in the tone of pure myth. Non-fantasy fans will enjoy this as much as avid readers of the genre for the performance alone. The Silmarillion is a history of middle earth and it’s heavenly origin that was shaped and reshaped over the course of Tolkien’s own life, and put into digestible form by his son. It is not told explicitly as a linear story following several major characters, but over the course different eras, major characters rise and fall, without failing in continuity or prose. It gives the universe that Tolkien imagined a sense of depth and expansiveness still imitated but never accomplished by modern fantasy authors. Treat yo’self to this reading by Andy Serkis immediately.",3 people found this helpful,Amazing,Andy Serkis is an amazing narrator. Hundreds of characters in this massive Middle Earth pre-history each are given a unique voice by Andy’s genius as an actor and narrator. The Silmarillion isn’t written like Tolkien’s Hobbit and Lord of the Rings and can be quite dry at times. Andy brings the Middle Earth mythology to life and makes it fascinating to listen to.,2 people found this helpful,,,,,,,

It was well written and beautifully narrated. The book traces a fictional Russian Aristocrat, Count Alexander Ilych Rostov who fled Russia before the outbreak of World War I and returned to Russia following the execution of the last Czar- only to be arrested four years later (1922) by the Bolsheviks and sentenced to lifetime house arrest in the Metropole Hotel in Moscow (near the Kremlin). The novel chronicles his 22 years of imprisonment in that hotel and through his eyes the listener enjoys a front row seat in watching Russian history unfold during the Stalinist period (including the Collectivization Farm Project, the Purges, a little bit of World War II and the beginning of the post-Stalinist period). While the count remains locked in the Metropole (and the world he has created for himself therein) the listener is given the opportunity to see how his world stays the same while all of Russia changes and the changes are exemplified through the people with whom the count comes into contact with- including his longtime friend from university, Mischa (a poet), a Soviet era actress (with whom he has a love affair), a little girl whose father was a Ukrainian bureaucrat, and then several years her daughter. The book was extremely well written and narrated that I finished listening to it in less than 3 days (which I normally never do). Some of the quotes from the count in reaction to the change in his circumstances are really profound and worth remembering. Admittedly there are some historical inaccuracies in the book but these in no way infringed on my enjoyment of the book.",41 people found this helpful,Ignoring Reality is Only Drawback,"""A beautifully written book about how one views the world. It is as large or as small as we choose to make it and for the Count, who spends 30+ years a prisoner inside one hotel, the world is very large. He may be the single most optimistic character in any book I've ever read, making Mary Poppins seem like a downer. Nevertheless, it shines. It is clear that Amor Towles loves words. And while he often takes 40 words to say what could be said in 10, I can't begrudge him the excess because each word is so perfectly curated and placed. Also, the narration of those words was spot on. Beautifully read. Unfortunately, while I have the imagination to accept that a prisoner could carve such a remarkable life out of two rooms in the attic of a grand hotel and the friends he makes through the years, it is harder to accept this premise when we know that going on outside the hotel is a country ruled with an iron fist by Stalin, a series of unsuccessful five year plans, starvation, overcrowding, the disappearance of friends and family through deportation, imprisonment or death. Oh, and World War II. No matter how grand the hotel is, it could not have been fully insulated from the despair surrounding it. This made the book ring untrue to me and kept it from being close to perfect.",11 people found this helpful,Amazing - I will miss Count Rostov,,5 people found this helpful,,,,,,,

Well the wait was worth it! The story begins with a year having passed since end of the last book. Sanderson deftly picks up where he left off, tying up loose ends and creating new twists. Michael Kramer does an excellent job of giving voice to the characters and creating a tapestry of the final empire from the books pages in the listener's mind.

I did not become aware of Brandon Sanderson until I read the Wheel of Time (WoT) series. After reading the last book in that series, I found out Robert Jordan passed away just when I finished reading the second to the last book (There was one more that was to be written - A memory of light). I researched and found that Brandon Sanderson was due to write the last book in the series. I wanted to find out what kind of a writer Sanderson was. The first book of his I read, Elantris, was excellent. I decided to try this series and found them just wonderful. The line I love from this series ( It sometimes repeats itself automatically in my mind, is ash fell from the sky. If you have read this book, you understand what I mean.

The politics were generic, the side characters were prone to apathy, the romance ‘drama’ between Vin and Elend was poorly done as I never thought they’d break up, the third character for the love triangle served no real purpose other than to create weak drama, and the title doesn’t actually come into play until very late into the book. If it wasn’t for the last chapters, which were great, I’d say skip it. I did like the new characters in this book (except Zane) and I appreciated the extra depth added to the crew members, a main complaint I had with the first book. There was also the ‘spy in the city’ plot line that I also really enjoyed, and I wish the book had more sub plots like it instead of drawn out, generic fantasy politicking and strategizing. The writing itself is good, though I’ve had enough of hearing ‘Lord Ruler!’ over and over. The book mainly suffers from plot problems. The narration is just as good as the last.",7 people found this helpful,,,,,,,

I don't know if I've just had too much time away from the shattered plains but the majority of this book was subpar in comparison to the others. The ending however was that grand Sanderson writing that we all come back for and what a way to end a series. Had a few elements that seemed rushed with the final edit but the over arching story was so compelling at the end and even had a few instances that were hard to gleam from the foreshadowing prior in the book. Over all this is certainly not the best book in this series but for a bridge boom that connected and progressed so much of the story it was pretty darn good. This wasn't no wheel of time Bridge book where you find yourself lost in the bland between very small bits of greatness, this was a storm light book that happened to need to set up a ton of information and plot lines for future books that somehow ended so well and neat.

I was so damn excited for this one because I knew it would be Dalinar-focused and I had to know what happened to make this man who he is now. Boy was I not disappointed, 12/10. The character work alone in this one was phenomenal, nearly every single character has caught my attention at this point, but damn is Dalinar good. I don't mean righteous (although he definitely is that also) but his arc has had such and dynamic and enthralling roller coaster of a tale that I would probably throw him up as either my #1 or #2 favorite fantasy character at this point in my library. I kept feeling for him at every juncture in the previous books but since this one with his backstory, I just wanted to give him a hug he felt so real. I could go on for paragraphs about the things I enjoyed about this book but in brief summary; the other characters' arcs still very much hold my interest, Shallan has grown on me. Kaladin is depressed as ever but I've really enjoyed most all of this screentime and probably enjoy him 40% better because of Sly (on that note, the spren intrigue me more each book and I really appreciated the more screen time with them) Kaladin's journey with the bridgecrew was also one of my favorite elements from this one (Michael Kramer uses the same voice for Lopen as he does for Wayne from Mistborn so now Lopen will always have a place in my heart). Adolin's whole story this time around was awesome, from the very beginning I was just on my seat waiting for the other shoe to drop, and the whole investigation arc was really fun. Im glad to see work with the bridge crew and excited to get more. The political machinations of this one were good, hope we see more of these inter-kingdom shenanigans as the war and other disasters start to play out more. The overall story was great and the pacing was good, but there were a few slower parts in this one than in either of the previous books (that being said its 1200+ pages, so that was to be expected). The only part that really hasn't hooked me is Venli (and formerly Eshonai) and their whole arcs, while I understand their obvious importance to the whole story, their individual scenes just didn't hold my interest, hoping this changes later on or on a reread. Overall, excellent execution. Taking a break before jumping into Rhythm of War (which will hopefully get me closer to W&W4 and Stormlight 5) but excited to pick it up from the momentum of this installment. 10/10, 12/10 for Dalinar",3 people found this helpful,,,,,,,

This novel will require readers to be comfortable with being uncomfortable - a place where thought and growth happen. We seem to have become a society who has forgotten this place as we are so committed to remaining comfortable. This novel is heartbreaking and beautiful. It explores various aspects of love, especially the type of love that requires a person to examine how much they trust it and themselves. It also happens to include (in a pretty normalized, not in your face way) a variety of diversity. It is so strange to me that when novels include humanized characters that happen to be Asian or Black, etc - the reaction is that the novel is “preachy” or full of “stereotypes”. Both can be true but are NOT automatically true because two side characters mentioned happen to be underrepresented identities. For those upset about any mentioned or raised social issues centered in the novel and feel that these things are contrived or also “preachy” - there are so many plots overly used in novels (starting over after a divorce, tragic love, the not so perfect suburban family, finding a lost relative, etc) that somehow have become normalized even though they themselves also are social issues or were once not normalized (divorce, oh my!). Also considering most published works still include mostly straight, cis, white characters going through these issues anything but may feel jarring - but nothing is being forced. It’s simply a story that happens to include different types of people which at this point - feels refreshing and I applaud Jodi and Jenny for their efforts to write stories that include characters reflective of the society around them. Again, enjoyable story with so many explored themes and hard truths that is worth finishing.",1 person found this helpful,I’m Glad I Read This Book,"I think I was meant to learn what this book imparts to its readers.

I like the historic angle and as always I like how he has no problems in showing how even now in the 21st century narrow minded people holds on to archaic prejudices in regards of race. Some characters names are a bit confusing because they are the same as some who have passed. You definitely need to be fully awake.

He pulled me into the story with no distracting affectation that you get from so many other recorded books of the horror/fantasy genre. However, the daunting 48 hour listen may have me augmenting the audio edition with my paperback. What other book might you compare The Stand to and why? Grant's Pass - by Amanda PIller. A post-apocalyptic anthology, well written and very fun to read. At times I felt that this collection was the 'lost chapters' of The Stand. Swan's Song - A very good read in the same vein, Robert McGammon is another of my favorites (unrelated but other great books by him: Boy's Life and Going South) The Road - by Cormac McCarthy.

Don't give up on it- go on the journey, you won't regret it!",207 people found this helpful,A Biblical USA Post-Apocalypse Lord of the Rings,"Stephen King's The Stand (1978/90) was an epic (48 hour!) listen. It's an ambitious novel, a hybrid of post-apocalypse sf like Alas Babylon, epic fantasy like The Lord of the Rings, horror movies like Nightmare on Elm St., and Biblical stories like The Book of Job, all set in a sea of American popular culture. People who like those genres (and don't mind profanity, sex, violence, and many hours of listening) would like the novel. The first part depicts the devastating outbreak of a military plague, the second shows the shocked survivors forming groups around two figures seen in dreams, and the third shows the climactic last stand (for now). King writes a suspenseful plot about human and changing characters. At times Frannie is too teary and Glen too much of a Heinlein know-it-all, but I love the sweet, mentally retarded Tom, the deaf and dumb leader Nick, and the Gary Cooper-esque Texan Stu. The Trashcan Man, Harold, and Nadine are morbidly fascinating, while Randall Flagg (aka the dark man, Satan's servant, etc.) is a charismatic supernatural antagonist. Listening to the novel etched many scenes on my imagination, among them Larry and Rita going through the Lincoln Tunnel, Nick and Tom hiding from a tornado, Joe playing the guitar by a fire, Mother Abigail presiding over a feast, the Kid and the Trashcan Man driving towards Vegas, Harold holding a walkie-talkie at dusk, Flagg interviewing Dana, and Larry, Ralph, and Glen doing a very difficult thing at a washout gully, and Tom, Stu, and Kojak sharing Christmas. Grover Gardner dexterously reads the voices of the many different characters (old and young, male and female, all from different educational, economic, and regional backgrounds) with skill, emotion, and wit. Hearing his Trashcan Man groan to the dark man, My life for you, or his Kid say, You believe that, happy crappy? or his Tom say, M-O-O-N--that spells tired etc., or his Flagg croon, I love to love Nadine, made me walk around imitating them. I can hear them now. Sometimes King overuses certain phrases (as when like a one legged man in an ass-kicking contest pops up twice), or his characters' expressions don't ring true (as when Frannie writes that Harold is a real boogersnot), or he tosses in one too many popular culture references (as when some tires are as bald as Telly Savalas). But I usually found his style vivid and page turning, and at times funny, scary, or moving. I dislike The Stand's cheap association of wolves, weasels, and crows with evil and its moving some of the responsibility for evil away from human beings and towards the devil, but I like its questioning of whether we can escape our fatal tendency towards too much organization, rationality, and technology in favor of free, irrational, and green alternatives: as Stu asks Frannie, Do you think people ever learn anything? and Frannie answers, I don't know.",15 people found this helpful,,,,,,,

Hopefully there with be some substantial plot development. Right now its like a supernatural 90210. XOXO",1 person found this helpful,Kind of... disappointed,"This storyline is incredible and has such potential... but it doesn't seem like that potential is going to be fulfilled. I was so excited when I started listening because I'm a Harry Potter fan, since I was kid, and this gave me the same whimsical feeling with adult themes and I was hype for that. However, I was waiting for a payoff that just never comes. I was hoping for more magic lessons. I wanted the twins to get a grip on who they are and #girlboss up. I know this is a bully romance but theres no romance and all bully. I can't even like these dudes a little and I do kind of like the girls but even they're a tough pill to swallow sometimes. I really can't get over how such a cool world and an awesome storyline idea got annihilated so terribly. It seriously makes me sad. So, if you're looking for advice on whether you should listen or not, I'll say this - the performance is great and as long as you don't expect anything incredible like I did, you won't be disappointed with a really cool concept. Just don't expect the satisfaction that comes from reading a book with a solid plot.",1 person found this helpful,,,,,,,

It is a world of magic and aliens where hurricane-like storms lay savage to the world every few days and all of its inhabitants must adapt their lives accordingly. It is a world at war between the human armies led by High prince Dalinar Kholin and the Parshendi, a humanoid species. We were introduced to Jasnah, who is a renowned scholar and the niece of the High Prince Dalinar Kholin, her student Shallan, and Kaladin, a slave that by the end of Way of Kings is beginning to become the world’s first Knight’s Radiance in centuries. If you haven’t read/listened to ”The Way of Kings,” I would strongly recommend that you do before going on to this second book, “Words of Radiance.” If you have read/listened to the first book I would recommend a review of TWOK before going on since it has been over four years and the second book starts off right where “The Way of Kings,” left off. At 48 hours and 15 minutes this is a long book, in fact Brandon Sanderson posted on his blog that he wrote the manuscript under the working title “the Book of Endless Pages.” He was referring to the endless learning set forth in his first book but it seemed appropriate given its length; but don’t let the length of this book deter you as I listened the hours seemed to fly past. This is an amazing book. “Word of Radiance” focuses on four characters: Kaladin, Shallan, Dalinar, and Adolin. In TWOK Kaladin was the main character and is still very prevalent but this book reveals more about Shallan. Like “The Way of Kings,” Sanderson interlaces the present with the past, developing the background on the main characters’ while moving the plot forward. This is only book two in a ten part series and even though I can’t wait for the next book I found the ending satisfactory. I word about the narrators, I’ve always been a big fan of Michael Kramer and Kate Reading and I thought they gave another great performance.",185 people found this helpful,Sleep....Work...Yea Whatever!,,8 people found this helpful,Brilliant!!!!!!,,4 people found this helpful,,,,,,,

This book is incredible. It was completely captivating and I listened to the final 10.5 hours straight through because I just couldn't turn it off. I usually don't listen to audiobooks for more than 3 or 4 hours in a day. This book is about surviving against almost insurmountable odds. The Great Alone begins with main character, Leni, and her parents, Cora and Ernt, getting ready for yet another sudden move. Ernt was a POW in Vietnam and returned home with a lot of issues that we know in current times to be PTSD related. He was unable to keep a job and constantly searching for the next thing and the next place that will make everything be okay again. This lead him to the middle of nowhere Alaska. We could pretty much count all of the people who lived in the town on our fingers and toes. There was no electricity, no running water, no inside toilet, pretty much nothing but a run down one room (with no door) cabin with a loft for Leni to sleep in. They show up completely unprepared and are lucky to meet some great townsfolk who immediately jump in to help them prepare their house and property and learn what they need to know to start out. Of course, their kindness rubs Ernt the wrong way as he takes it as them saying he can't take care of his family rather than being neighborly. Things get worse here as the weather and darkness bring out the worst in Ernt and his paranoia increases as well as his violence and physical abuse of his wife. He becomes big into doomsday preparation and is obsessive about it. He feeds off of another doomsday person he meets there. It gets extreme. Even though Alaska is insanely cold and dangerous, Leni finally feels that she has found a place to belong and a place to call home. She is lucky enough to meet a best friend in her school of 5 students. He is a boy her same age. She is eager to learn and really thrives in the environment and becomes attached to some of her neighbors but due to her father's mistrust and controlling ways, has to hide her friendships. This book blew me away. I practically hung on every word. There were a few really emotional parts too. I pretty much sobbed during one part, which was awkward because I happened to be driving when that happened. There were several times where I noticed that my heart was beating super fast and I was either on the edge of my seat or up and pacing around. The only thing that I wish was different in this book is that I wish we got more of a what happens next at the end of the book. I need more. The narrator was wonderful. I don't have a single negative thing to say about the narration. This felt like a flawless narration. Her voices were excellent and she read so perfectly, switching between characters that I didn't once get pulled out of the story. It all seemed so natural and believable. Whereas many books, I am constantly aware of the narrator, in this book, I was not. The pacing and emotion was all perfect as well. This audiobook is definitely worthy of a credit or even paying full price. I highly recommend The Great Alone. I will probably buy a print copy of this book to read as well but either way I know I will listen to this audiobook again.",9 people found this helpful,Amazing Alaska,"""captivating, informative story. gave me a new appreciation and respect for Alaska and sympathy for victims of domestic abuse.. well read , wide range of voices made the sorry come to life.",4 people found this helpful,Unexpected,"I downloaded this book based on the author.

And also, without exception, I found that I waited days or weeks before I began the book, because I needed to be ‘ready’ for the kind of ride that King was going to take me on. I waited a week or so before starting this book and right away, I could tell this was different. It almost seemed like a ‘normal’ book, full of ‘normal’ characters, with barely an inkling of horror. Yet it was honest and compelling and I couldn’t stop listening. It wasn’t until we were well into the book that we began to delve into some of King’s usual genre, yet even then it was subdued, without losing its interest or edge. The main character was brought to life superbly by both King and the narrator, and when the book was finished, I was truly sorry to know I would not hear more from Charlie. Kudos to the narrator who gave a near perfect performance. I will seek out further books with his narration.",9 people found this helpful,King has outdone himself,"""I haven't been on an adventure like this in a long time.

This tale takes place in a land known as the Seven Kingdoms. However, these kingdoms are actually ruled by a single King with various Lords under him. The history of these kingdoms is expertly blended into the plot, so that you effortlessly become emersed into the world. I can't overstate the skill with which the author draws the reader into his world. It feels as if this land, with its people, traditions and history is as real as our own. Magic does exist in this world, but it is rare. It is used to color the plot, not to dominate it. There are hints of other races, but varieties of humans are all we encounter. There is some profanity, but it's fairly rare and in context. There is some sexual content. I wouldn't recommend this book for children. Large sections of the plot revolve around the palace intrigue of the King, his family and the Lords. This is a book about the nobles of this realm and, as the title suggests, the high stake games they play for power. The characters in the book are deep, colorful and simply splendid. Their lives have a depth to them that few authors accomplish. I confess that, when not reading the book, I actually thought about them during the day and laid awake wondering about them at night. In the audio version, the narrator does a wonderful job of giving voice to these vivid characters. The plot has numerous twists and turns. Sometimes I think the author intentionally speculates about what the reader would expect in the plot of a fantasy novel, and then does something completely different. I gave up trying to predict what would happen, and decided to just enjoy the ride. However, there is an overall master plot that is slowly unveiled in this and subsequent books. If you enjoy fantasy, this is a must read. Even if you usually don't like fantasy, you may very enjoy this one.",375 people found this helpful,Everybody is apparently a chain smoking old man.,,132 people found this helpful,Excellent book; not suitable for children,"I had to cut this book short some months ago when listening with my 12 year old.

Having run out of audiobooks, though, I decided to give this one a try again and really enjoyed it. It's long, and stops just as things are really building up, so be warned.

It introduced three new point of view characters with three different narrators, which in concept was a good way to expand the scope of the story but wasn’t executed very well. I honestly didn’t care enough about the new characters for their storylines to hold my attention, save for one. Even Darrow’s chapters were so far removed from the man he was that I didn’t enjoy them. The writing is still beautiful and the world building is still there, but this felt more like the first in a new series in a new time and place than a continuation of the previous. Even then, not much progress was made and it just felt like it was setting up future novels. That is fine for a first book, but not a fourth.

My first books by Sanderson were those of the Mistborn Trilogy. I was totally captivated by the story and its writing. I avoided The Way of Kings because of its Audible 2 credit price but finally caved because I had lusted so long for something so good as Mistborn. I should not have delayed. The Way of Kings was well worth the price and promises to be one of the best ever series by Sanderson or any SF/Fantasy author. This is Book 1 of the Stormlight Archive. Coming in at over 45 hours on audiobook or over 1000 pages in print, for some TWoK might seem too lengthy. Personally, for me, it ended all too soon. The book was totally gripping and absorbing. I could not put it down. The writing contains wit and charm, adventure and philosophy, comedy and pathos. It’s all there, a wide range of human thought and emotion. While constructed of multiple arcs, the writing is completely straight forward, accessible and easy to follow. I became totally invested in each character and cared for everyone of the good guys and even some of the bad ones. One of the most interesting characters, one named Szeth, is a peace-loving believer in nonviolence but is also an ultimate, ninja-like assassin who hates to but is forced to kill and cries each time that he does. How’s that for a crazy mixed-up contradiction. Frankly, I think that Szeth is a metaphor for many of us and our behavior. But among my favorite and central characters were a peasant, apprentice surgeon named Kaladin and a spren named Syl with whom Kal has a rather magical and symbiotic relationship. Spren appear throughout the book. They were for me various types of conscious energy or spirit-like entities that were part of or associated with almost everything on the planet including specific kinds of thoughts and emotions, wellness and sickness, life and death. They particularly seem to appear when “change” happens and it is at least at this point in the series difficult to know if they are responsible for, contribute to or are just present when changes in anything from one’s health to the weather occur. Speaking of the weather, the environment and particularly the atmosphere of the planet and how the geology, flora and fauna have evolved within the influence of extreme weather is integral to the storyline. The book describes and develops half a dozen interesting and well defined fictional races. Wars exist on the planet among them over the power and dominance brought by the magical weapons known as Shardblades and Shardplates. And, while war is one of the central themes of the book, descriptions of battles and war do not dominate the narrative. What came across most movingly, uniquely clear and beautifully written were the two human qualities of love and compassion. I do not think that those two attributes have ever been more deftly portrayed than it is in this book. Some of my other favorite SF/Fantasy writers including Dan Simmons and Peter F. Hamilton while brilliant in almost every other respect, fail to adequately communicate those two essential qualities of our nature. Other authors talk about it, their characters go through the motions and maybe say the words but I just do not always “feel the love” in their writings like I do in reading this book. The humanity and heroism portrayed by some of the characters in TWoK were strikingly remarkable. It is another one of those attributes of Sanderson’s writing that makes everything more real and capable of eliciting emotions within the reader. Magic abounds in the book and all of it seems to make sense if ever magic can be made sense of. It was once said that any technology sufficiently advanced will appear as magic and this is that kind magic, magic that can almost be but not quite understood. There is plenty of adventure and excitement contained within the pages and Kate Reading and particularly Michael Kramer bring it all to life. Yes, this is the same duo that narrated the Wheel of Time saga. Their talent was well highlighted there but I believe even more so in The Way of Kings. This was one great book and the only downside is that Sanderson is so prolific with his other literary pursuits that the sequel to this one is long overdue and the Audible rendition even longer than that.",521 people found this helpful,Very Detailed.,"""It definitely earned a five star rating, as sweeping epic fantasies go. Sanderson takes us into the heads of each individual protagonist, and many of the 2nd level characters. The quotes are both creepy and portentous, as well as overdone and vague. The secret behind their harvesting is terrifying. This book starts with a quick dramatic plot point, and then ebbs and builds, slowly, until the last five or so hours, where everything gets tied together, and presents a promising setup for book 2. Brandon Sanderson's writing style, in this book, reminded me of Robert Jordan's; where you'd have these intricate meandering progressions, and suddenly a plot twist would rattle the storyline. I feel it's worth the two credits, and regret waiting for the next book in the series, but at least we're guaranteed it will be out before The Winds of Winter. I'm not the biggest fan of Kate Reading's narration. Something about the way she draws out the words 'eyes' and 'oaths'. She has a great voice and she would be good for a single pov novel, and for R. Jordan's books, since his female characters are all so similar. She's not the best at diversifying her voices, or at male voices, so it's sometimes hard to tell who's speaking. Probably, it's just me, and I'm sorry I couldn't give the book a 5 star narration, as it deserves.",56 people found this helpful,THANK YOU BRANDON SANDERSON (AND KATE / MICHAEL),"Waiting for next Wheel of Time and Song of Ice and Fire...(not holding my breath) Been through Codex Alera, Saga of 7 Suns, Sword of Truth, Mistborn, Prince Roger, Discworld, Deathstalker, etc. etc. etc. Looking for another long series.

Demon Copperhead manages to surpass Poisonwood Bible in its breadth, wisdom, compelling characters and (no doubt) the most research on a dizzying number of topics, historical and contemporary. Kingsolver is an American literary giant. The audible version add an extra level of enjoyment. The narration is perfect. It adds flavor to the book that, unless you’re from Appalachia, you’d miss. I’m glad I listened to this book. I’m sorry it ended. It’s beautiful and violent, horrifying and tender. You can’t help but fall in love with the protagonist (written in first person), a young boy experiencing the worst kinds of life, from poor orphan in abusive foster care systems to an athletic star until he can’t play anymore and is criminally fed the most addictive opioids until he sinks as low as he can and fights his way back into life. When you finish this book, you’ll have a new appreciation to the mountain rednecks and you’ll be furious at the system that has abused them, then turned them into the butt of the national jokes. I could go on. I could write a book about this book. It needs to be read, then studied, and absolutely earn a Pulitzer or a Nobel. Or both. It should be required reading in high school English AP classes and in universities.

Honestly those excerpts were the most interesting part of the book for me. ?? I never felt the romance between the hero and the heroine, he just wanted her and she enjoyed and got off on the fear.

I didn’t want to read this book. I hate war stories. I read it because my daughter-in-law begged me to. She read it and loved it, but we generally tend to read different genres. I grudgingly used a credit and promised that I would read the book as soon as my two other books in the queue were finished. I finally got to this one and put the book on, and increased the speed, thinking that I would be glad to hurry it up and get it over with. Boy was I wrong, and I knew early on to put the speed back to normal. As the description says, this story is about two sisters who experience the war into very different ways. What the description doesn’t talk about is the intense relationships that are built throughout the book, the intense experiences that are lived through, and the very real visions of what could definitely have happened during that time. Yes as some reviewers have complained about, there are historical inaccuracies. However, this is fiction, not a historical biography. People get so bent out of shape about that, but I feel that this book instilled in me a desire to seek out more about the history. We all know about Nazis, and Hitler, and the war, but maybe we don’t know about somebody’s point of view perspective, or experiences. This just gives us a glimpse into some of the possibilities. The narrator did an absolutely phenomenal job. It was as though the book was written with her narration in mind. Between the author and the narrator, I was able to fully immerse myself into the story, build relationships with the people, feel their happiness, love, heartbreak, uncertainty, fear and pain. I am desperately sad that its over, and I will most likely do something I very very very rarely do, and read it again. I fully and completely recommend this book. Just try it.

It is a window into one families life in France during the Nazi occupation between 1941 and 1945. I wish it could be reqiured reading in our schools, for it provides a view that our young people today will never get first hand as we lose the generation who lived and fought through this war. We post war Boomers think we know and understand what our parents went through, and maybe some of us do. But this story is one that shows from a woman's point of view, the bravery and strength it took to survive, and the heroic efforts some took to help others. It reminded me of when I would ask my Mother about the wartime and she only answered It was a different world then. The narration was excellent .

Marin Ireland is the best audiobook narrator working today and with the added (considerable) talents of Michael Urie, I expect this recording to be nominated for all the awards.

I've never read or listened to a book by Colleen Hoover, but have never experienced a better treatment of her subject matter. She then confirmed my thoughts in her epilogue- and boy, does this book deserve an author's epilogue. This novel is storytelling at it's finest; you see that most of the other reviews are one or two lines- that's because it is such engaging, exquisite storytelling, that when the plot begins to turn, the reader is as surprised as Lily, Hoover's perfectly crafted heroine. Nobody wants to give it away. Narrator Olivia Song is perfectly cast- I had some reservations when sampling the childlike voice- but Hoover's Lily calls her own voice 'weak' and Song gives a bravura performance. It is a perfect production. So do yourself a favor and stop reading reviews- they might give too much away and you really don't want that- just spend the credit. 'This Ends With Us' is- as Lily says- awesome.",28 people found this helpful,WOW.... JUST WOW,"""I too listened to this intense, emotional, heartbreaking and heart-achingly beautiful story in one day... why? well right from the start the characters captured my interest, the story tugged at my heart strings and I just HAD to know whose heart would be broken and how it would all end. However I didn't realize that my heart would also be broken along the way too... because there were times of such overwhelming joy during this listen that made me smile and laugh, such romantic times that I felt like swooning... but there were also such sad and devastating times that I cried ugly tears. Colleen Hoover has written an epic and powerful tale of love in its many forms - and the hard painful reality that sometimes, sadly, it's simply not enough. This is a 5 star Author who's words have touched my soul, shattered my heart, pieced it back together again and left me feeling absolutely drained from all the emotional turmoil contained within this awesome listen. Olivia Song did a great job too at bringing it all to life. Worth a credit? Oh it's worth so much more than just one credit.... so please don't hesitate to use one of yours.",14 people found this helpful,Best book of the year.,This will be the book of the year.

A lot of people couldn’t stand Rhys and Fey in this book and complained about how they were toward nesta but why should they bankroll her downward spiral?

I could have stayed here forever!,2 people found this helpful,Less is A’mour,"""Yes! I did intend a pun in the title of this review. It also works as a pun with the title, “Less is More”. Author Less is the name of the main character. The choice of the last name, “Less” is ironic in nature. The setup of the story is Author Less, as a youth (age 21), was the love interest of a famous older man and poet from the Russian River School of writing. After years of inspiring the man and work Less is abandoned, as the poet’s active lover, however still remains within the circle of the literati class due to his own prize winning novel. There he exists until he also takes up with a younger love interest, Freddy, who nine years later abandons Less so he can marry a lover nearer his own age. In order to avoid attending the wedding Less accepts a series of engagements that will take him in a around the world odyssey (classical pun intended) during the time of the naturals. The bulk of the book is a recounting of this world tour journey as Less engages in introspection of his life, the meaning of life, and his feelings of loss and failure. The journey is full of mishaps, funny incidents, in addition to the usual travails of travel. During this trip the reader is invited to bond with Less and empathize with his lot in life. The reader comes to see Less is not as shallow as originally portrayed at age 21 and not just this empty shell of a man he sees himself as. Thus the original idea for the title, “Less is More”; above. Then why did I chose, “Less is A’mour”? Will I can’t divulge that without spoiling the end of the book. However, the A’mour term suggests the happy ending. The writing style is fun, witty, and entertaining. However, if you are looking for a sizzling flesh bacchanal to send you blood rushing south, buy a different book.",2 people found this helpful,Delightful,"Everything about this book, (story, writing, and narrator) is delightful.

It paints a painfully clear picture of the anti-woke mob and where their magical thinking and how incoherent ramblings spawn from.,,Accessible book about one of the divisive issues of this century,"""Easy to comprehend and follow, well-structured and cleverly written collection of arguments against the anti-gender movement. It provides a roadmap for thinking gender that reaffirms its critical and analytical edge by linking previous research and Butler’s own thoughts.",,I wasn’t afraid of gender; I’m even more solid now,"I wrote an email to Judith Butler. I realized it can serve as a review (below). Whereever you may have started on the questions of sex, gender, gender identity—that set of topics, I think this book will expand your horizons and give you things to think about, even (maybe especially) if you don’t agree with every word. I’d like to be clear, there is much I disagree with; but I love it that Butler (they/them) invites people who disagree to talk together, to join each other against common enemies. To be honest, it’s not always clear that Butler would listen to disagreements by reasonable people, but I’ll take them at their word. If you have read “Gender Trouble” you will find this clearer and with a positive message about what we might be able to do together. I needed a guiding light in these difficult times. That light is coalition: “If you’re in a coalition and you’re comfortable, you know it’s not a broad enough coalition.” (Bernice Johnson Reagon quoted in “Who’s Afraid of Gender” by Judith Butler) Here’s what I wrote to Judith Butler: Dear Dr. Butler, A few minutes ago, ? I finished with your voice reading me Who’s Afraid of Gender? You have influenced me (for the better). Understanding gender has been an important part of my life since the days I watched my parents fitting and misfitting their roles. I am one who has kept his first sex assignment and have spent 70-odd years “[establishing my] relationship to that assignment.”(p. 185) You will perhaps want to know that you and I agree more now that I have finished your book than we did before. I’m pretty sure you didn’t change while I was reading, so it must be me. I have read a lot in this area (many sides) and struggle mightily to understand and to be better able to influence those with whom I interact (a full range of the spectrum of ideas and opinions). You have helped me be clearer, you have invited me to rethink some things I was somewhat settled with. You seem intent on having that kind of influence and it worked on me (Gender Trouble was helpful; I like how you’ve evolved). In particular, I want to be part of that coalition (endorsed by Bernice Johnson Reagon, p. 245) that I’m not fully comfortable in. I am deeply saddened and distressed by the contentiousness among people who ought to be making cause against a common power. I so much value that thread running through the book: that we dampen our strength through internal divisions and invective. I wish you were here drinking coffee with me; we would have some things to disagree about and we would see we are on the same side. I mentioned an amendment in my Subject line. In the paragraph starting at the bottom of Page 214, you are discussing the size-of-gametes argument. The last sentence of that paragraph reads, “In these cases [species of algae, fungi, and protozoans with the same size gametes], the species is divided into genetic groups known as ‘mating types,’ but sex falls out of the picture” (my emphasis). I suggest you revise it in later printings to read, “…mating types, but ‘male’ and ‘female’ fall out of the picture.” Surely whatever disagreements there may be about what sex is and how many there are and the rest, there is agreement that two haploid cells joining is sexual reproduction. The notion of something being sex but not having anything to do with male and female is a pretty fun concept, in my mind. I hope you won’t think this is nitpicking—when I am going to have a serious conversation about sex and all the topics you discuss in your book, I start with sexual versus asexual reproduction which, in some versions, has no relevance to male and female. I don’t want to end without noting the warmth I feel in the book—not many pages go by without your inviting us to remember our humanity, our ability to work together and all of the forms of love we can have for each other. Thank you for your book. It has served me well in my own growth and will contribute greatly to my conversations, left, center and right. Dan Matthews Albuquerque",,,,,,,,

I’ve been in a reading slump recently. It’s been hard to find a romance with real emotional growth from trying situations that aren’t so tragic that they’re too much to take because 2020 is a dumpster fire. I completely forgot about social distancing while watching Luc deftly schmooze donors for CRAPP. I liked Oliver enthusing about his career & making sure jokes weren’t mean spirited. I cheered when the hotelier refused to give out personal information about a guest. It was great that no one went stalker - they said their piece & took no for an answer. The solid couple of chapters full of parents and (appropriate) F-words were tense and interesting and healthy. I liked the use of internet grammar (such van, much emergency; clean all the things: we baconed in silence) and supportive friends. I agree with the SBTB review that suggested a longer or additional final scene or epilogue would be in order. Not so much because they were lacking, but because I wanted more time with Oliver and Luc being together & good for each other. Revisiting the hedgehog boxers was a nice touch, but what I like about fake relationships is how they nudge the characters back together again and again until they catch their groove. There was so much good togetherness in the book as a whole, after a couple chapters of apartness (forgive me), I wanted more time with them being together again. If you want a comedic romance that has light & fluffy moments, a running side gag of escalating book emergencies, good & bad parents, and emotion enough to tug the heartstrings, read Boyfriend Material. (If you haven’t belly laughed by the ~3rd page/chapter, it’s not your kind of humor. It is exactly the kind of humor I enjoy so I LOLed a lot.) Steam: Low.

However, the authors style of intertwining many different stories and timelines made it hard to follow. Also, the character development of Travis was shallow. The long descriptions and analogies went on and on and were hard to follow. I was tempted to not finish the book after the graphic description of the sex act with Travis which added little to the story for me . The descriptions of the sites were often flowery and poetic but very long and didn't fit in with the culture . Overall, the story line was fractured and left me not knowing what kind of a person Little Dog or Travis were, although Lan and Rose's characters were pretty well developed. Also, I was left with little hope for Little Dog and a deep sadness.",6 people found this helpful,Listen to this one.,"""Poetry, and yet, its prose.

That kitchen table conversation that Pierce has with the person he married about Will near the end was agonizing - I'm not saying who so no spoilers from me!

As I got it on audio I have to say Jacob Morgan of course played Will/Auden to perfection with so much passion and deep felt love, it took you deep into how he was feeling!

I don't know what more I can say about this book besides WOW! Madame is the 6th and final book in the Salacious Players Club OG series (keep in mind I said OG). We FINALLY get to know more about the mysterious Eden (AKA Madame Kink) and what her story is. While we have learned little bits here and there, the more we learned the more we knew she had a good story. We learned a little in The Highest Bidder, that Eden has someone else she is taking care of, and when we first see her in Madame, we learn she has a son, Jack. When she was younger, to make enough money to get away from her Jack’s dad, she signs up to be Ronan's (Highest Bidders) sub, but he quickly realizes she is not a sub. Far from it. He also recognizes she needs help, and being the person he is, Ronan takes her in. Thus, their friendship is made. We also met Clay in a previous SPC book and could sense there was some tension between the two. We see Clay become the sub to Eden's Madam Kink, but they both broke the first rule, they fell in love. While Clay wanted more, Eden had herself and her son Jack to think about. Up till now, only Ronan knows about Jack, not the club owners and not Clay, if she were to let clay in, she would need to tell him about Jack and that terrified her. So, she cut ties, and broke his heart. He eventually (seemingly) moves on and meets Jade, his boss’s younger daughter. But things come full circle when they happen to run into each other at the movies, along with Jack. Jade senses something between Clay and Eden and when Clay opens up about what he and Eden did, suddenly Jade is feeling self-conscience that she is not enough for him. So, she does what any women might do in this situation, she goes to Eden for Domme lessons. But again, the rules are broken, and Eden and Jade end up falling for each other. Clay is skeptical of bringing Eden back into his (their) life because of how badly he was broken before and now he knows she was keeping big secrets from him. But the more time the three spend together, the more they just can’t stay away. I was so happy to have this rerecorded so I could enjoy it again. Muffy and Maxine were absolute rock stars in this production. Muffy really brought Eden's character to life and was able to play her hard and tough Domme side, but also play her so soft and vulnerable when the Madame Kink mask came off. Maxine NAILED the sweet, not entirely innocent, and curious Jade. Brandon Francis is seemingly newer to the audio world, as he has less than 10 books in his Audible catalog, but I hope this shoots him into the spotlight because I want more of him! I can’t imagine the nerves that might have come from doing a rerecord under the circumstances, but he handled it in STRIDE. He played Clay so well I can’t wait to see what more he does, and I REALLY hope Sara Cate uses him more. I am so so happy with his addition to this.",,so steamy and heartfelt,"""loved everything about it!!! its a sara cate book for goodness sakes!! of course it was amazing!!",,Outstanding Story & Listen??Consuming & Heartfelt!,"Sara Cate never ceases to amaze me with her incredible writing style and ability to create captivating stories. Once I start, nothing else matters except what is going to happen next, and I am completely immersed in the story and the world she created. Through her descriptive writing, you can see, think, and feel everything the characters do. This sixth book of the “Salacious Players’ Club, the last book of the series, is Eden St. Claire’s story. Eden aka Madame Kink is a highly respected dominatrix, and the most requested in the club. She has been with the club from the start and her input helped make it into the success it was. But there is so much more to who Eden was, she lived two lives, her life in the club and her life as a single mom of a darling son, Jack. She aced both lives but always kept them separate, except for a couple of people, she did not let anyone get close. So when she developed feelings for one of her subs, Clay Bradley, who got too close to her, she automatically pushed him away. She broke Clay’s heart and when he finally moved on with his life and found happiness with another, Jade Penner, he runs into Eden again and it stirs up his feelings again. Meeting her stirred up something in Jade too, and she felt the need to learn more about her and her world in SPC. I loved how everything played out in this book, the plotting and world building is fantastic, as is the character growth and development. It was great to watch the relationship between the characters grow, sure they had to work to get their HEA, but their love for each other prevailed. The dynamics of this trouple is absolutely amazing, and I loved the epilogues and to see how much they all grew. This wonderfully plotted story has a perfect balance of drama, angst, heartfelt emotions, and steamy romance. Sara Cate, thank you for another amazing story and emotional rollercoaster ride. I am hoping this is not the last we see of these characters and the fabulous world you created. ?? ???? Muffy Newtown, Brandon Francis and Maxine Mitchell did an amazing job bringing these characters to life and did so with a complete understanding of who they were portraying, giving each a voice that was fitting and were believable in every role. Newtown killed it as Eden, grasping every aspect of her personality, from a loving mother to the well respected and kickarse Domme that she is and everything in between. Francis nailed it as Clay, grasping his personality with perfection. Mitchell did the same as Jade, capturing her youthfulness, sunny disposition, and eagerness to learn. They were just as amazing performing the roles of the secondary characters, too, including Jack. They set the perfect tone for the story, captured all the characters’ emotions and had you feeling each one. These entertaining storytellers are a pleasure to listen to, and their narration elevates an already brilliant story another level. Thank you for another fantastic listen.",,,,,,,,

Klune has become not only an Auto-Buy author for me, he has also become one of my favorite authors....period. His whimsical, yet ALWAYS emotionally impactful stories, are always so unique and somehow end up pulling me in so deeply to the story that I feel like I am actually there along with the characters. His breadth of ideas....of creating so many different types of stories, just shows that his talent knows no boundaries and is ALWAYS, always consistent. This story is another one of the whimsical stories that he has become known for. It introduces us to a world where only machines exist. But as usual, the group that we get to meet and follow along with are not your normal machines. They have created a family - a family that consists of a small vacuum cleaner, a sadistic nurse machine, an sweet and loving inventor, an android named HAP and a human boy. We get to learn exactly HOW they became a family and the lengths that they will go to to protect this family even if the risks are extremely great. As always, there are messages in almost every section of this story. Lessons about self esteem, about friendship, about loyalty and especially about love. Daniel Henning did a wonderful job narrating a story that I'm sure wasn't easy to narrate with the various eccentricities of the characters, but he did a great job. In my mind, the whimsical books from Mr. Klune are sometimes better experienced on audio rather than reading because the various unique voices of these somewhat odd characters somehow add even more to the story (I mean, how do you decide how you are going to portray a small yet extremely talkative vacuum cleaner?) While this was not my favorite book from Mr. Klune, I still really did enjoy it. The ending felt a little rushed to me and I think the storyline lost a little steam during the last quarter of the book. With that being said, it was still an amazing book and I am looking forward to whatever is next from Mr. Klune.",1 person found this helpful,Excellent as usual,"""Not quite as magical as The House on the Cerulean Sea but not many books are.

Like a really detailed outline of the characters, rather than an actual story. There are no bad guys or action or really any antagonists. It's just some people went somewhere. I can see why it got awards, though, even though I'm bummed it did. This book is rife with political and societal opinions. If you're progressive or an Identitarian who loves intersectionality you'll love this. If you are conservative or a liberal that doesn't buy into Identitarianism, you'll probably not like it. Here's why [SPOILERS]: There are nine characters on this ship. The first was raised by two dads. The second is in love with the AI. The fourth comes from a species that is known for orgies within large family groups and free coupling who then enters a lesbian relationship with the fifth person. The sixth is a species that starts out female but transitions to male as they age. The seventh goes through a change where their pronouns change to they (although zir and zero come up.) The eighth is hated by everyone. The ninth is a pacifist captain in love with a different alien we run into at times. Sex, sexuality, identity, and relationships that cross taboo lines are celebrated and really what the whole book is about. Under this is an environmental message of how the humans destroyed their planet by ruining the environment, how aliens are misused by evil capitalists who supply weapons to both sides of a conflict, and how newer aliens to the GC are taken advatange of for their (fuel) resources. If this author didn't intend to be really clearly a proponent of leftist/ progressive political views it would shock me. If that's your thing, then you'll probably enjoy this book. If it isn't, you'll probably find yourself wondering why you're reading this at all.

Looking at its awards and nominations I was hoping for a sophisticated hard sf treatment, something like Cherryh or Varley or Elizabeth Bear or KK Rusch might deliver. Becky Chambers' worldbuilding is excellent, on a par with anything in the field, but the story was entirely too fluffy for me. It was a telenovela when I was hoping for Masterpiece Theater, cotton candy when I was ready for meat-and-three.

The ever talented Haley Cass has written yet another very beautiful friends-to-lovers story. Imagine “Notting Hill” meets “Friends with Benefits”. The story is overall fun and explores this beautiful friendship between two very different people. It also shows great character development for the two friends. The ignorance of Gianna’s existence by her narcissistic family is heartbreaking. Riley’s duty and loyalty to her family in the absence of her late father is also touching. I’m a bit peeved at and also endeared by how unrealistic the situation is though. Riley is described as this average girl with fluctuating weight who essentially puts this mega influencer built like a goddess in the friend zone for a decade! Kind of ridiculous, but I suppose that’s the whole point? And it’s Lori Prince. *mic drop*",,beautiful,wonderful story. I definitely felt for Giona and it was such a heartfelt HEA.

So as soon as this audiobook dropped, in my cart, then playing on my mobile device. And the performance, as always, was superb. I easily fall into the work and so appreciate the nuances of the performance such that the emotions of the characters - both primary and secondary - come to life as the story unfolds. The novel itself is a departure from this author's usual fare with the college setting and young/new adult-aged characters. But, as ever with M. Brayden books, I do get caught up in the angsty roller-coaster romance ride with the well-developed characters and well-paced plot.

The title seemed too … cute. The book cover seemed too … cute. The theme seemed too … cute. Wow, am I sorry I waited. Red, White, and Royal Blue meets and exceeds the attention it has earned. It has everything: warmly drawn and winning characters, a wonderful story, fascinating settings, romance, cut-throat politics, hilarious humor, palace intrigue, current events, love of family, thrills, pop culture, history, sex (very, very hot sex), excitement, love, courage, betrayal, hope for the future, fireworks, and a cliffhanger or two. Reading this book, you will be utterly charmed. You will also fall in love, you will often laugh out loud, and sometimes, you will cry. Oh, will you cry. I read this by following the Kindle e-book text while listening to the brilliant voice acting of award-winning actor Ramon De Ocampo. He was a revelation. He nimbly navigated different characters, different accents, even different languages in a way that gave great life to the story and depth to his characters, and he did it all with a seeming ease and total naturalness. I've rarely heard a more assured and enjoyable performance. If you're thinking about buying the Kindle version, buy the Audible version to go with it. You won't regret it. Lastly, Red, White, and Royal Blue benefits from a second reading. The author's subtle foreshadowing, her placement of little clues of what's to come, is even more enjoyable the second time around and gives a second reading depth and nuance. You'll enjoy it even more the second time. Especially in these times, we need things that bring us a little escape, a little brightness, and sheer joy. Red, White, and Royal Blue does exactly that. Highly, highly recommended.",79 people found this helpful,"History, huh?","""I LOVE THIS BOOK. There, that sums everything up.

The exchange of text messages and the emails are something to behold in this book, especially the emails! It's wonderful to see how their relationship gradually developed and once fully established, it's more wonderful to see them fight for it, in their own way. If only America was already like this... I think it's what drew me into this book.. that hopeful wistful dream of America being this accepting and open. It's my first listen to Ramon de Ocampo narrate and he did a great job!

I've never listened to any books on training before we decided to get this little guy. Our last dog was trained by us 15 1/2 years ago - and we had two other dogs at the time - so I guess he sort of trained himself. We're much older now and having lost our last baby 8 weeks ago, we had some concerns about bringing a new dog into our lives. I can't live without one so I immediately started preparing for a new one. My husband thought that I was crazy. I listened to the first few chapters several times before the arrival of our new baby. He arrived Thursday morning at 1:30 am after days on the road from Missouri. I followed what the authors said about when you receive your dog. It didn't matter that it was 1:30 in the morning. It is now just a few days - he loves his crate - and has had a handful (maybe even less than a handful) of pippi mistakes. He is only 2 pounds and his bladder is tiny. He sleeps 4-5 hours in his crate (going into it on his own). When he wakes up I take him out and he is then returned to his crate. He slept this morning until 9:40 AM! I will continue with the following chapters when we are ready. Perhaps it's the book, perhaps it's the puppy - perhaps it's a combination. I really found this book to be so helpful. I should have had this for my last puppy - 15-1/2 years ago - listening to this I understand the mistakes that I made especially about separation anxiety. I won't make those mistakes again. I highly recommend this book to anyone getting a puppy - whether it's your first or fifth pup. Thank you for making this so much easier for me.",,Awesome!,"""Straight forward and to the point!

I had just begun to foster Belgian Malinois puppies for the Military Working Dog (MWD) program at Lackland in San Antonio. They are like no other dogs, even as babies. I also understood the secrecy surrounding them in the military, especially the special forces dogs, and I had met several of the handlers who had served with these dogs. Our puppies are sent to the four service branches and would be trained at Lackland. Special forces and secret service have their own programs. When their dogs appear at the Holland Veterinary Hospital on base for treatment, great secrecy surrounds them; no one even admits their presence. That's how unique and treasured they are. I watched with rapt attention as President Obama met with the fabled Cairo who was muzzled for civilian safety. We raised the babies, from 8 weeks to 7 months, and often had minor bites and scratches from their teeth and claws. I could only imagine the damage an adult, fully combat trained MWD could impose on someone who made the wrong move. It made perfect sense that Cairo wore a muzzle when he met the Commander in Chief. Even now, MWDs are muzzled in public, always, even the breeding females who are often fostered with experienced civilians when not whelping or actively nursing their litters. The puppies are removed from the mother at the tender age of 4 weeks and now go out to foster at 6 weeks because of the damage their rough, aggressive play inflicts on mom and litter mates. They are a force of nature. Really! And the Special Forces MWDs are elite among these. I was delighted to see nearly 10 years after his service on that historic raid, Cairo's story was to be told, by the handler who had worked with him and served with him. I was especially happy to know that in the end, when Cairo retired with honor, he was allowed to go home with that handler because I knew something of the bond that forms between these dogs and the people they work so closely with. Will Chesney tells his personal story and that of Cairo in this book; it rings true to everything I have seen and observed with Belgian Malinois. I live now with 6 of these adult dogs, most of whom we raised as puppies but who failed for various legitimate reasons to make the cut as working dogs. They literally are the center of our lives, requiring continual training, supervision, and attention. They are never outside or free in the house without one or both of us present. Will Chesney got the dog right in his book, and he did not fail to respect Cairo's power and potential to cause serious harm while giving him the love and companionship these brilliant, sensitive creatures require. He had his own demons which helped him relate to those of this complex canine. He loved the dog beyond all reason (as I do mine), but he also understood and accepted that he was not a normal dog. Malinois are not for most families or most normal people. They are difficult and always challenging, a dog like Cairo so much more so than my crazy, washouts. If these dogs interest you, this is an excellent book. It is honest and blunt. It is not always happy, but it is realistic and inspiring as well. I wish Will Chesney all the best, a life of purpose and fulfillment . He, like Cairo, has earned it. And please, do not get a Malinois until you have fostered several so you know what that will mean to your life...it will change completely.",8 people found this helpful,Must Read (or Listen),"""Wonderful book.

He's shown a variety of rooms, each of which belongs to a particular denomination and in which those particular people are doing whatever is common to their little sect of Christianity. The denomination at the butt of the joke changes with who's telling it, but the last room is always occupied by that denomination and the angel says Shhh, that's the So-and-so's. They think they're the only ones here. And the angel and the man tip-toe by. Kingsolver writes a good book of course, but she's like the denomination that thinks they're the only ones present on the issue. Left wing types have bought into their own hype that they're the only ones trying to save the planet and the right wing types are all at Walmart buying Roundup. A little less smugness and a more generous spirit would help her influence a greater number of people. Joel Salatin is on the opposite end of the ideological spectrum and he's arguably one of the most influential people on the scene today for making a real difference.

Unlike most of his works, this one has portions that some parents will want to pre-screen before reading to young children because of explicit references to animal sexuality, detailed accounts of collecting specimens for artificial insemination, etc. And, additionally, parents should be aware that this was a hard-drinking culture, and Herriot didn't minimize that fact. The story is also oddly disjointed, making frequent jumps from the 1940's to the 1960's and back again, which detracted from its quality in my opinion. However, it's still very enjoyable because Herriot had a wonderful eye for beauty, for humor, for poignancy, for sorrow, for joy. And he knew how to set it all down masterfully on paper. And the narration? Well, it's Christopher Timothy! What more needs to be said? He's wonderful.",2 people found this helpful,Best listen ever!,"""What a joy this series is!

I love the fact that he goes into detail on such things as food basics and the how & why things were done in the past. I regret that in about 6 short hours I'll have completed the book and will be waiting impatiently for the next.",2 people found this helpful,So many things to like here.,Bryson is one of my my favorites and this book did not dissapoint. It is filled with many interesting facts and stories using the rooms in his home as a sort of plot device for this study of the Western history of habitation.

I almost stopped listening as I thought it was a waste of my time. But, I have to admit it works. Timing myself doing chores is something I had never thought of. I was shocked by how much time it took just to do my out of control dishes. My dishes had sat for months in the sink. Every dish in the house was dirty, all the silverware and plates. So, I bought more paper plates and washed a fork or spoon every time I needed one. When I finally took her advice to do the dishes it took me 111 minutes just to clean off the dishes and get them in the dishwasher. This happened in two full loads over a course of two days. This does not count the cost of the time for the dishes to wash and to put them away. I was shocked at this huge investment in time and realized why subconsciously I avoided this task like the plague. Seeing how much time my procrastination costed me was a huge motivator for me. Time is like money in the bank and by saving little amounts of time by procrastinating on the dishes it cost me a huge investment to actually get it done. This seems like common sense and it basically is. But, by breaking it down and just starting this book motivated me to complete this monumental task. Once I completed the dishes other projects did not seem so daunting. Its a matter of doing something, anything, is better than nothing. This is a great book for professional procrastinators. I have ADHD and it motivated me because she connected with me on a level that did not overwhelm me. This book is not for those that create and follow excel sheets on cleaning their home. But, it is for those that would like to have excel sheets and a clean home, but it all just seems like too much work and is too overwhelming. Thank you to the author for writing this book and for connecting with us that are motivated differently than the Type A personality.",3 people found this helpful,The best!!,"""I have read so many cleaning books over the years and this one hit home for me!",1 person found this helpful,This is the one!,"This is the book (and blog and podcast) that really did it for me!

In this book, she discusses specific noted ideas with the over arching theme of being more intentional about what is on your plate. As someone who is doing everything I can to get “back to the land” to get more connected with my food, hearing these food values put so eloquently into a book is life giving to me. If you even are slightly into environmental issues, agriculture, or just making a dang good meal at home; this book will absolutely leave you wooed by food.",,Worth a listen,"""Liked the themes, but the author should've brought in a professional narrator. Her speech was slow and stilted, which distracted from the content.",,"Good message, but take with a grain of salt","Overall, Alice's message is great. Of course everyone should eat local, organic food. Of course we shouldn't be eating McDonalds and other fast food. Of course fresh food from local farmers is better than mass produced industrial farmed food. The issue with the book is that it doesn't really provide a real solution, it just highlights the problems and says what people should be doing, but doesn't tell people how to get there. It's a good listen and has some insightful information, but it seems a little tone deaf and elitist at times. It doesn't really recognize the fact that the reason people eat fast food is because it's more affordable that organic, grass fed, locally grown, etc. food. I recommend you listen to it at 1.5 speed as Alice talks very slow.",7 people found this helpful,,,,,,,

I’m not what I would consider an “animal lover,” so I hesitated. OK, I admit I was wrong! This is an astonishing memoir. It focuses on Carr’s relationship with a beloved cat, Masha, and yes, I learned a lot of interesting things about cats and other animals because Carr always exhaustively researches his books. But to me the book soars because Carr uses his relationship with Masha to write some hard truths about life: understanding who you are, how your past has shaped and limited you, fighting against that but ultimately accepting those limitations, what it means to be fully present for someone else, overcoming challenges because you have no choice, love, connection, disappointment, loss. So many sentences were memorable for me that I wished I hadn’t listened to an audiobook version of the memoir.

On the negative side there were complaints about the language. Yes there are some instances of language that would not be appropriate for a Sunday school class but I did not find this excessive or gratuitous at all despite what some reviewers said. Many men who make it through BUDS use language on occasion that is not appropriate in church. Seriously a guy gets his thumb shot off and you think he is going to do put his hand on his hips, pout like Shirley Temple and say Golly gosh, Mr. Terrorist I wish you hadn't blown my thumb off. I really liked it and used it a lot. You are a mean person. If you are that person wake up and grow up. Secondly there were comments about the narrator. He is different but I think that the people who found him off-putting had their own issues. I took me about 5 minutes and then I found him to be not just good but an excellent narrator for this book. I only wish I could rate him 11 which is better than 10 stars (Spinal Tap reference). Lastly there were complaints that the author told too many 'war stories'. I did not find them excessive. I also know that stories are very powerful and useful tools for teaching. For Christians we have the example of Christ using parables to put a doctrinal teaching in context and make it more memorable and powerful. I find this method of teaching very useful in my own life. When I began listening this book my initial thoughts were that it was a good book. As I kept listening I thought this is a really good book. As I listened further I thought this is a real gem of a book. After listening to it all the way through I was so glad I decided to buy it. In fact, I liked it so much that I bought the Kindle version and plan to buy copies for people I care about. I also plan to read it again within the year, probably within the next 3 months. So here is my advice to you. Try it like I did. Listen to it all the way through and see if you agree that this book is worth much more than you paid for it.

This epic (and I do not use the word lightly) tome is less about Hamilton than it is about the era in which he lived. Chernow's talent is to place his character in context. I learned more about the revolutionary period than I ever expected. In the end, I was conflicted about the subject. Hamilton, at least as chronicled here, was not a particularly admirable character. In some ways I was content to say that I would rather have lived with my own preconceived notions. But at the same time, Chernow recreates a vanished world that is uncomfortably familiar; perhaps too much so. Like many of the principles in Hamilton's own life, I was left with a profound combination of pity and admiration for the man. But in retrospect, the most amazing thing about this story is that Hamilton did all that he did and yet is a relatively obscure character in American history. Although Chernow amply explains all of the reasons Hamilton is not lionized today, one is still left with a sense of personal guilt that we have not done more to recognize the contradictory brilliance of Alexander Hamilton. I agree that this piece reads like a novel. It is a classic page-turner. But the rages and torments of Hamilton's life eventually began to wear me down. Perhaps that was Chernow's plan? By the closing chapters of the book I found myself more than ready to see Hamilton's demise. His self-destructive antics could not lead to anything else. In the end, this is a tragedy; and a damn fine one at that. Ron Chernow may just be responsible for rewriting a big chunk of American history. The test of the influence of this biography will be if we see the construction of a Hamilton Monument in Washingtton, D.C.

The narrator also did a good job. For me George Washington truly is the father of United States. I think Mr. Obama should listen to this audio so he can understand what a real president is. This book also is on the New York Times bestsellers and well worth it. My compliments to the author he did an excellent job writing this book. So don't hesitate absolutely download this book.,27 people found this helpful,The First American,"""Guard against the impostures of pretended patriotism. - George Washington My first exposure to Chernow was his now über-famous biography. My daughter owns her own copy of Chernow's Alexander Hamilton and just today showed me Chernow rapping Alexander Hamilton dressed in the show's distinctive revolutionary garb for #Ham4Ham. We were lucky enough to see Hamilton in NYC. So, now, after President Trump's election, I'm finding spiritual solace in reading a book-a-day (at least in January) and trying to read at least one presidential biography a month (this month I read two, this one and Caro's The Path to Power, LBJ #1). I need to be reminded that, yes, politics has always been nasty AND -- yes -- this too will pass. Anyway, while I didn't like the George Washington bio QUITE as much as I enjoyed Chernow's Hamilton bio, it might have been for reasons beyond Chernow's control. I've read a bunch of Washington biographies and there isn't much that I haven't come across, or at least knew if not in form certainly by shadow. There wasn't much here that was surprising, but as a biography it was compelling. Chernow did a masterful job of threading throughout the biography certain Washington traits and contradictions, the biggest being his views on slavery, and his treatment of slaves. The fact that Chernow didn't write a hagiography but was trying to paint a full picture of our first president was obvious. As far as biographies of Washington go, this one beats Ellis' His Excellency: George Washington by a large and straight rather than prominent nose. Chernow is technically more of a journalist than a historian, but in this age of modern biographies there is certainly room for the self-taught. In many ways, journalists often produce fantastic biographies since they often have a distinct narrative talent. That doesn't mean Chernow isn't historically rigorous in his historical efforts. Many of the primary sources are ones I hadn't read before, or were ones used in a different context. So, while I don't think Chernow writes as well as Robert Caro, he still belongs on the top shelf of living presidential biographers. So, now after this I'm going to definitely have to read: 1. Titan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller, Sr. 2. The House of Morgan: An American Banking Dynasty and the Rise of Modern Finance 3. The Warburgs: The Twentieth-Century Odyssey of a Remarkable Jewish Family I own the first two, so obviously, I'll start with those.",19 people found this helpful,"Good book, great character",I enjoyed the character of Alexander Hamilton better in a previous book by Chernow but this book on Washington was a better and more interesting read/listen.,17 people found this helpful,,,,,,,

However, Kearns Goodwin manages to do just that. It's the backstory that hasn't been told in one complete narrative. She stays remarkably on track by focusing on the players in the cabinet and Lincoln. There are also sub-characters she provides with remarkable interest - like Chase's daughter and the two secretary's to Lincoln. There are other small players who add to the story but Kearns Goodwin never strays from from the main thread. This book is a phenomenal listen. My only criticism is for the reader. Toren, while fitting the narrative with a fine, strong, persuasive voice, at times is too precious with her pronunciation.

The book lives up to its name as it allows the listener to see clearly how Lincoln must navigate the egos and pride of his cabinet while also solidifying respect for himself, not easily given to a man believed to just be a farmer. I appreciate the books analysis of the core issue of slavery from the Missouri Compromise to Dred Scott and the broader build up to dis-union.

The author uses the large caches of cuneiform tablets that we have unearthed over the last two centuries as the organizing principle, but she doesn't stick to only the royalty, generals and priestesses. She gives us a vibrant picture of the everyday lives of skilled artisans, slaves, and the very scribes whose chronicles have lasted more than 4,000 years. A note on the narration: the author reads her own book, so there is no faltering over complex ancient names. AND she has a delightful voice with something like the BBC Standard British accent which so soothes American listeners.",1 person found this helpful,Insightful look into lives in the Ancient Near East,This is by far the best audiobook on the Ancient Near East. The author tells the history of the region from the 4th millennium BC to the Persian conquest by giving us snapshots of people’s lives throughout the time frame. These are told from the cuneiform tablets found and show the amazing details about those lives that can be deduced from these tablets. So one gets both a sense of the larger sweep of the history combined with an intimate portrait of the lives of specific individuals. The narration is enhanced by the author herself (an eminent scholar in the field) performing it. She has a very pleasing and warm voice. Highly recommended.,5 people found this helpful,,,,,,,

Research in this book was 10/10. Well researched and had a sizable list of cited sources and authors. Writing was 5-6/10. At various points I zoned out for a minute and the author was still belaboring the same point without adding anything new or interesting. Concision is not something this point does well, and it’s also bad at signposting where the author is going with things. Voice performance 10/10. I was impressed that the reader got all the academic words and even the french terms correct. Engaging way to listen to it. Analysis was a 6/10. Let me preface by saying I disagree with the central thesis of the book, namely that egalitarian models of human society which existed previously can be emulated today. With that bias aside, I assess that the authors play fast and loose with their analysis. Several case studies point to of ancient civilizations and basically say: “We don’t see anything hierarchical, therefore we have to conclude they were egalitarian.” Not the case; they need positive evidence to make a positive case for their model. All they’ve done is try to shift the burden of proof onto others. That being said, there were a lot of subclaims I found interesting and insightful. There are a lot, and I do think some of their better analysis does deserve mention. In particular, I liked their takedown that individuals had to organize into states and that the march to modern nation states was inevitable. Likewise they did a good job of showing that civilization and technological development (agriculture, metallurgy) are not linked. Overall: 8/10. The book has a lot of interesting analysis, though the main thrust of it is pretty shaky. The writing could be improved and shortened. Overall I enjoyed, and I thought the audio format was actually a good way to digest it.",9 people found this helpful,RELIVING THE PAST,"""David Graeber and David Wengrow persuasively reject the view of farming as a critical step leading to tribes, hamlets, villages, cities, and future nation-states. Graber and Wengrow’s archeological research reveal human remains and structures are found in many areas of the world long before any evidence of farming. Their research suggests hunter-gatherer populations created and sustained stable communities with remnants of worship, government rule, and tools for construction, punishment, and defense. These early civilizations knew nothing of or practiced any form of organized farming. The goal of the author’s research is to find an answer to the question of why inequality plagues civilization. They suggest inequality is (in part) created by the myth propounded by stories like the bibles’ garden of Eden. The myth of original sin and redemption sets many precedents for inequality and redemption through good works. Their archaeological research suggests the plague of inequality has never been cured because history and archaeological evidence shows civilization wobbles between extremes. First, there is the altruism of sharing benefits of life with everyone. Second is the realism of what is mine is mine. Graeber and Wengrow argue there is history and archeological evidence proving both extremes exist but the second prevails more than the first. It would seem the first is more likely to preserve humanity, and the second to end it. This is not light reading or listening, and it remains a speculative story of civilizations’ growth, and organization. It seems a more careful examination of archeological evidence than the farming explanations from different authors like Fukuyama, Diamond, Pinker, and Harari.",3 people found this helpful,Listen to the Sample First!,"Several reviewers have complained about the reader; I think he’s fine.

The narrator was just okay. Easy enough to listen to, but I was relying on him to get the pronunciation right on names I'd never heard before. He pronounced them with authority which sounded convincing, until he came to the Hebrew section, where I knew how the names were pronounced and noticed amateurish mistakes on his part. This really spoiled the book for me because I think if you're going to narrate a history for people trying to educate themselves further in the subject, you should at least get the pronunciations right!

It looks at the event both in a broad picture analysis of the migration as a whole, and narrows focus to the experiences of three individuals who made the move from South to North. I liked the many comparisons she made to the immigration process that my ancestors would have experienced coming from Europe and how similar they were to African Americans moving north. The use of three particpants biographies really personalizes the listen as you come to like and respect them to varying degrees. The stories of these three ordinary people taking part in an extraordinary event draws you into the story completely. The author writes so well of them that it proves a biography does not have to focus on the lives of great men to be interesting if it is so well written. You celebrate with them when they experience success and may shed a tear when they experience loss or hardship. The book is particulaly enlightening on the African American experience in the South and North. The biographys are broken down into three eras. Life in the South and what drove people to leave. The move to a new life in the North and the early struggles to assimilate into a new culture and finally the long term establishment of a life in the new land. She makes many persuasive arguments about the stereotypes developed and how the migration changed both the North and the South and the people involved.

I love that he carried his violin around like a baby, and turned to it whenever he needed to let of steam, or just to think. He was the most right brained scientist I have ever heard of, which is to say, he was very balanced. Watch out, educational administrators!

Although I loved Macintyre's own reading of Rogue Heroes, glad John Lee is back to lend his voice to this wonderfully engaging story. Lee's excitement and enthusiasm, and his ability to convey Macintyre sly humor, are perfect for this story. I bought both the audiobook and kindle version, unsure of where/when I'd read it, but I found Lee's voice so captivating, that I've let him read the whole thing to me.

I can't imagine todays leaders embracing him at all with his rhetoric on personal accountability or the way he talks about the democrats buying the black vote with zero results to show for it in the actual community. We see the same thing today, Black people continue voting blindly democrat with nothing or little to show it for it. The ghettos still exist and the discrepancies still exist no matter who we vote for. In part because I believe people miss the message of accountability and the lack of real interest by politicians beyond self promotion and power. There is a constant movement to lower the bar so to speak for people instead of building them up. This is exactly what Malcom X stated time in and time again. Oh, I think most would hate him today. The reliance on government was something he spoke about avoiding at all costs. What the black community really needs is to be built up to start with education. This means holding teachers accountable for results in the black community. Malcom X has a sense of community that is truly beautiful and he found it through religion. I have always said despite my atheism, there is merit in the community that religion can bring. Today this community idea is dying. We simply slap band aids on gaping wounds. Where I did struggle with Malcom X thoughts, his view on history. Why? Well it simply isn't correct. Many of the colored empires as he describes them, were also founded on the blood of conquered peoples to include slavery and sacrifices. To praise an empire like the Persian Empire and attack another that was formed the same way, either speaks of world ignorance or willful ignorance. Either way, his view on history is uneducated at best. However, I don't think that takes away from his message, his importance and what should be an even larger more taught legacy. I highly doubt many people who talk or use Malcom X to add validity to their points today have actually read him. I truly believe if he were alive today, both political parties would hate his message. One thing is for sure, the average American reads 4 books a year. So, more than likely if you are debating about Malcom X, you are debating someone who has read nothing.",2 people found this helpful,,,,,,,

It's also just plain fun; there's a lightness to it because eternal matters are only peripherally involved.

Endurance,History,Alfred Lansing,Simon Prebble,,10,20,4/8/2008,16.65,25272,4.8,4.8,4.8,20683,3496,829,167,97,19042,2620,569,98,49,18996,2490,643,127,79,Superb in so many ways,"This is unquestionably the most amazing tale of men against the elements that I have ever read or heard, and it is told remarkably well by Lansing who draws artfully from the actual diary entries of the participants without ever reducing the narrative to a dry progression of quotes. His ability to bring the harrowing conditions and landscape, the fascinating array of characters, and the grueling sequence of challenges and hairsbreadth escapes into sharp and riveting focus is quite extraordinary. Simon Prebble is a perfect match for the fine writing. He audibly sorts out the personalities involved and presents the whole with an understated but charged clarity which keeps the narrative moving even through what could seem like a never ending and tedious progression of disasters in the voice of a lesser reader. Of course the real stars here are Shackleton and the men under his command who prove themselves capable of feats of courage, endurance and simple, stubborn determination which almost surpass belief. Ordinary and flawed in so many ways, they come together to become much more than the sum of their individual qualities. In the end, the most fascinating part of this story is the long and torturous series of life and death choices involved. Time after time Shackleton's decisions are crucial to the party's survival, whether the question is when to abandon the pack ice for the boats, when to kill the dogs, when to allow the party to split, or how to get to the bottom of a nearly vertical snowbound precipice in order to avoid freezing at high altitude (think Butch Cassidy and Sundance). Nature is an implacable adversary for these men, marshaling countless terrifying storms, thirst, cold, hunger, completely unpredictable ice and long weeks of winter darkness against them and time after time crushing hope just as it seems most justified. Perhaps the most extraordinary decision of all, under the circumstances, was the choice each of them made to simply keep on keeping on when it seemed to make no sense Finally, while this tale is exhausting in some ways, it is also deeply inspiring and satisfying. And Lansing and Prebble have given us the wonderful opportunity to experience it all while sitting in comfort and safety. Almost doesn't seem fair, but I strongly urge you to take advantage of the offer.",182 people found this helpful,No Fiction can match it.,"""Great Story, on a great man. Any fiction story who would try to match it would be so unreliable. Strongly recommended",11 people found this helpful,We had reached the naked soul of man,"Before satellites. Before GPS. Before computers. And most importantly, before radio. Well, Guglielmo Marconi won the Nobel Prize in 1909, but his discovery/invention were still novelties in 1914, the year Ernest Shackleton and 27 men and some 60-odd dogs sailed off on the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition. The adventure lasted far longer than anyone planned. Alfred Lansing's Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage (1959) is the meticulously researched and detailed story of that expedition. Lansing used diaries, ship's logs, and interviews to reconstruct the journey. Clichés like ill-fated and cursed were created for this particular trip. What amazed me was the skill and ingenuity of the sailors, especially Navigator/Captain Frank Worsley. In the later part of the journey, Worsley used a chronometer and sextant to plot locations, making his calculations when the sun broke through frequent storms. I like books about adventures at sea, but reading the text, I get bogged down and twisted in the details and give up. I had that problem with Sebastian Junger's The Perfect Storm (1997) - I got the trade paperback, read a few chapters, tried to calculate wind speed and wave heights myself instead of reading on, and gave up. Endurance would have been worse for me - I would have puzzled over longitudes and latitudes, trying to remember how minutes and seconds worked for global positioning, and lost a thrilling story. I liked Simon Prebble as narrator of Endurance. He did a good job with multiple characters. The title of the review is a quote by Shackleton. [If this review helped, please press YES.

Nothing else comes close to its readability and scope, and Shirer's presence in Germany as a reporter at the time allowed him to add many personal observations that add greatly to the authenticity of the book. While the book is now about 50 years old, research since its publication has changed few of its conclusions. It is less academic and detailed than Richard Evans triology of the period, but I found Shirer's book both more complete in its observations and much more readable. The quality of this book is evident from the fact that in all of that time, and with all of the books on the period that have been written, this book has never been out of print. And though it needs nothing else, Grover Gardiner's flawless reading only makes the book even better. This is easily one of the 10 best books I have ever read from Audible and I recommend it without reservation to anyone with an interest in World War II in Europe. A word of caution - this is not a dispassionate book. Shirer had definate opinions and those are not hidden. His distain for many of the primary players is clearly evident in his descriptions and that may offend some readers. This is not an academic book (See Richard Evans' Nazi trilogy for a dispassionate academic telling of the period), but no other book comes close to its readability and comprehensiveness. It covers the political events and there is no concentration on the war (see Richard Atkinson's WW II military trilogy for that).",181 people found this helpful,Extremely long and sometimes too much,"""Okay, so here's my take and advice. This book has lots of details, and actually had more than I could handle at times. Some parts focused solely on the politics and correspondence between some figures whom I've never heard of and others, whom I'd also never heard of. At times while listening to this book, I actually just set down the headphones and let it play. I felt like I wasn't missing much due to the subject being focused on some diplomatic event that occurred well before WW2, much less WW1. However, at other times I found the book very interesting. The beer hall event and the tone that Hitler took with his mission is one that stands out. If you're looking for just the WW2 sections and when they're knee deep into the war, you'll have to skip all the way to Part 6, Chapter 4. This is the part that captured most of my interest, and it explains how the downfall of the Third Reich came to be. From this point all the way to the end of the book focuses on the actual war with the Allies. Beforehand has lots of details that I really couldn't manage to listen to, simply because I had no interest in the subject. So if you're interested in mostly the War, then I'd advise skipping forward. Now don't get me wrong, I do agree that this is an important piece of documentation on what can happen when a mad man goes into power and completely destroys his own nation. There are tactics and methods that remind me of some politics today, propaganda wise. I'm a WW2 buff and am glad that I read (listened) to this book. I have more insight about the Third Reich now than I ever had before, and a thousand years from now, I hope this book will educate others about what happened. Similar to Plutarch writing about Alexander the Great, what little we know about historical events/figures is sometimes dependent upon one person's view or writing. This writing will suffice on this historical event for many years to come.",10 people found this helpful,Incredible Detail and Delivery,"I can't say enough about how I quickly and absolutely I was drawn into this book. I was a little skeptical of a documentary book of this size but those doubts were quickly dissipated. The amount of reference material that William Shirer must have gone through to finish this book is mind boggling. I was completely captivated by the story and the level of detail. I've tried to watch a few documentaries after having listened to this book and cannot finish them. They pale in comparison compared to the level of information this book delivers. I thought Grover Gardner did a very good job with the narration and really helped make the plots, subplots, and stories come alive. If you are looking for more than your average documentary about one of the largest pivotal events in the 20th century this book is for you. You will find yourself being reminded many times that, Truth is stranger than fiction Enjoy.",6 people found this helpful,,,,,,,

If you google it, it’s still there in Oklahoma but is in disrepair.",69 people found this helpful,Cultural Horrors in the North American Indian Wars,"Empire of the Summer Moon, researched and written by S. C. Gwynne, and narrated by David Drummon. This is the story of the most vicious of all the Indian wars fought on the North American continent; the fight between the Comanche nation, first with the Spanish in New Mexico, then the Texans (and the famous Texas Rangers), and finally, the United State of America. This is the story of the war and the required destruction of the Comanche nation. Any Indian nation story having to do with the destruction of the North American Indian peoples is going to be measured in the shadow of the seminal, Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee. Bury My Heart explains how the indigenous nations of North America came to realize the white migrants to their lands were far too numerous to withstand. So, as nations, entered into treaties to hopefully provide the opportunity to live in peace and preserve traditional life. Truthfully, in Summer Moon, we learn no Indian was ever going to abide by a paper agreement in any case; documents meant nothing to him/her. Also, notwithstanding the written commitments, the migrating white Americans treated the original natives as being less than human, and therefore any obligation to a savage does not require fidelity. As such, Bury My Heart and Summer Moon are filled with holocaustic undertakings; by both the white settlers against the Indians and the Indian nations against the white settlers. The debauchery, hatefulness and vehemence that is explained in Bury My Heart is fathomless. Empire of the Summer Moon is about one of those Indian nations, the Comanche. Prepare yourself for a stunning realization; the ledger of atrocities falls more heavily upon the Comanche. Summer Moon is about common human wickedness. In Summer Moon, S. C. Gwynne, instructs us in the very evil content of the American Indian’s nature. If Gwynne is to be believed, we come to learn of the disrespect most Indian nations, and especially the Comanche had for other humans who came to them, through theft, trade, or outright war. In fact, the Comanche’s, and other Indian nations, according to the story, have a cultural bias to be horrific to their adversaries. That is not racism. That is just an explanation of the natives' learned cultural values. The Comanche, were merchants, but included in their mode of commerce, was the acceptability of not only fair trading but duplicity, and stealing wealth from others was also very acceptable. Yet it gets worse because in that practice of taking what you can if what was taken was another human being, it was their value that torturing the captive males to death and raped, pillaged and enslavement of the taken woman were proper acts. Any children were selectively treated like the defeated men or the captured woman. No assurances which way the matter may come down for the infants. According to Summer Moon, the Comanche were not trying to be impure, it was just their cultural origins that they followed. The Comanche’s were, for our purposes, the Mongolian hordes of Asia between 1206 and 1368. They had the same physical features, a similar societal milieu and a fierceness for fighting from mobile ponies as did the Mongols; and their nation spread as did the Mongols, through war and causing catastrophe on others. The genius of each society was their ability to learn war from a horse was strategically more potent in open plains warfare than relying on infantry. It is anguish to read the horrors one must learn to study to understand the history told here; but If it is mankind you wish to understand, this book is a step in the right direction for cataloging the nature of our species as horrific. As harsh as its contents may be, it is told wonderfully well, as its facts and stories are an organized compilation of data that delineates the people’s origin, development, wars, tactics, and demise. Very fact-intensive, but told in short episodes focusing on individuals and their part in the overall history. Oh yes, and the story has a wonderful flip in characters at the end. The book has a surprise ending. I have always admired our native American heritage. This book though, was a drastic realization the American Indian, is no better than then we, and we are no better than them. In effect, we still have the horror of our lack of compassion for others to overcome. Can we?",5 people found this helpful,,,,,,,

It is for all Americans who like stories of courage and determination and people who have made their mark in history. The story begins as hopeful boys show up at Washington to try out for the university rowing teams. As the book progresses, the teams are chosen and begin their training. Alternately, you will get a glimpse of Berlin as it prepares to host the 1936 Olympic Games. The book goes back and forth between Berlin and Washington until the final American Olympic team is chosen and travels to Berlin. It was interesting to hear details about the sport of rowing which I knew nothing about. I even looked on Wikipedia to see a diagram of the seating positions so I could understand the titles of the different rowers and how they contribute to the overall speed of the boat. What I enjoyed the most was the massive effort made by Hitler and the Nazis to hide the real Germany and appear to the world as a beautiful, peaceful Berlin. There was a little too much character development of each of the boys in the boat, but I suppose it contributed to the overall story. The best part of the book, of course, is the end when the Washington rowing team competes for the USA on the world stage. That is followed by an epilogue which updates each boy's life after the games. PERFORMANCE - Good job. Some people from Washington complain about mispronunciation of local places. This Texas reviewer didn't notice a thing. OVERALL - Recommended for just about anyone. There is no cursing, violence or sex. My only criticism is I thought it moved a little slowly at times.",15 people found this helpful,"Well rowed Washington,well rowed.","""Where does The Boys in the Boat rank among all the audiobooks you’ve listened to so far?

I'm a mismatched person - even those who are closest to me will say. I'm recommending this book to everyone I know. It's needed now more than ever when many of us feel on the cusp of a shift in - not only the USA - but the world. How do we see each other and how do we get each other so wrong? Our interpretations of our interactions with strangers differ greatly from how they see things. Malcolm answers the why in a way that allows the reader to critically think about their own behavior.

Next Will Patton comes along.He has read a number of Stephen King books and is a marvelous dramatic reader. He can do the voice of evil really well. The transition is all the more jolting for the listener. From Romper Room to Stephen King. Suddenly you're listening to a totally different book. But you'll want to continue on because the story is that good. At the end there's Danny Campbell -- another fine reader, and another adjustment for the listener.

Will Patton comes riding in on his dark horse, just the way he does in every James Lee Burke masterpiece, to bring the narrative to life with his whispering snarl and resonant emphases. Suddenly you're the lawman in the 10 gallon hat shaking up J. Edgar Hoover's bureau out where the law gets slippery, and the narrative picks up and takes off. The third narrator is an elderly fellow who reads the first-person segment about how so many more Osage were killed than were previously thought. He's fine.

Unmasking Autism,Health & Wellness,Devon Price PhD,Devon Price PhD,,9,51,4/5/2022,18,1582,4.7,4.7,4.7,1366,104,33,26,53,1197,98,33,22,32,1173,93,34,27,48,Eye Opening and Validating,"This book was amazing. Dr. Devon Price has such a pleasant voice to listen to. They spoke plainly in a way I found easy to follow as they help the reader, or in our case the listener, understand autism better. In a gentle but firm and unwavering manner, Dr. Price tells the listener to throw out harmful neurotypical views on autism and instead listen to other autistic people. They remind the listener, or teach them, in my case, that too many neurotypical people place their own convenience or doxastic comfort above the happiness and healthiness of their neurodivergent counterparts. Or, to say it plainly: too many people insist on believing and enforcing the belief that there is a universal or even mandated Normal, that Normal is good and right, and that doing anything outside that Normal, even if it harms no one and makes the ‘abnormal’ person happy, is bad and wrong. Unmasking Autism is about rejecting the frivolous Normal and doing what makes you happy, as well as fighting for a world where everyone can do so. If you disagree with the belief that we should all fight for a world where everyone can unmask safely and happily, I beg you to listen to the WHOLE book before tossing it aside. Hold off your objections to whether anyone is being oppressed or wronged until you’ve listened to all Dr. Price has to say about how it actually feels to be an autist in a world that was not built for you, but rather was built to grind you into a palatable fraction of who you really are. Dr. Price’s intersectional perspective reminds them, and therefore allows them to remind us as the listeners, that autism (and indeed, life in general) does not look the same for everyone. They explain this with academic evidence as well as anecdotal stories shared with them from other neurodivergent people. There’s even a small but weighty and meaningful emphasis on how neurodivergence in different demographics is viewed by neurotypical society, and I appreciate that when they speak about the difficulties and even dangers of unmasking one’s autism when one is, say black, for instance, they use examples given to them by black autistic people. This book really opened up the door for me to question myself and the world I live in, and I truly believe I am better for it. It helped me learn to love a part of myself I and my family have been first ignorant and then resistant to for most of my life. I highly encourage everyone, regardless of whether or not you think you’re neurodivergent or know anyone who is, to read/listen to it. To that point, I want to recommend that you ignore, or at least set aside until you finish the book, any angry one star reviews complaining about how the book is too ‘woke’ or ‘indulgent in victim mentality’. It’s literally the author saying ‘hey autism and some other neurodivergent conditions aren’t something one needs to fix or hide in order to make neurotypical people happy, and we should fight for a world where no one is forced to do so.’ It’s about unabashedly being one’s autistic self. And yes, in order to achieve a world where people can be themselves happily and safely, a lot of social injustices must be corrected and left behind. This will always grind the gears of those unwilling to ask themselves whether they’re a part of the system that’s hurting others and whether they’re okay with that or not. Please, for yourself, and the rest of your teammates in this game of life, ie; literally everyone on the planet, PLEASE give this book a listen with an open mind and open heart. Also, the definition of doxastic is ‘of or pertaining to belief.’",2 people found this helpful,I used to think my mask protected me…,"""This book shifted my perspective on autism as well as myself. I’ve worked with autistic individuals for years. Teenagers on the spectrum were always clocking my neurodivergence but I was one of the “everyone is a lil autistic” people until doing research and deconstructing a lot of what I learned in school.

Formation of various chemical compounds etc. I’m sure I could go back, take notes and make sense of it but my point is this book seems to struggle to decide if it’s a work for scholars and researchers or for consumers. Both are addressed but it often felt less focused than I wanted it to be. I didn’t see the need to paint the Obamas as victims of the system nor Trump as a liar. Neither advanced his case and felt like political plugs. I also didn’t see the point of reiterating his position on global warming. It added nothing to the book and detracted a bit from it’s credibility. Climate change is way more complicated than can be shoehorned into a couple paragraphs of (highly disputed) data, as if ‘here’s the answer’. If he would like to do a book on climate change, do that, but this just seemed to be an airing of opinion (which related tangentially at best) All that said, I found his main points easily understood, well presented and well supported (as best I am able/willing to analyze that… and the background information was generally very interesting as well.)

I am 2 years now with no sugar and no processed food. I now cut up veggies every night and garnish with a side amount of wild fish or grass-fed beef. So yes, he was preaching a bit to the choir. But I feel it is important to continue to read/listen to his side of the story and reinforce the message. Because Big Food is continuing to inundate us with the opposite message. As some people have mentioned in their reviews - the book gets political. And many people don’t like that in a “health” book. Those people are missing the whole point. Much of our food problem originates or is exacerbated by our government and the exact regulatory agencies the government creates to supposedly protect us. So government is half the problem. We need to be educated on this so we can hopefully fight it.

One can perfectly well enjoy the book as it is, and only go check videos when needing a fuller picture. The manuscript was originally twice as long, but the publisher finds it expensive and unconventional to publish a 1300-page book (or a 50-hour audio).

So much of it is so profound and explains so much about my past and the patients’ I have taken care of over the years (hearing their stories and now putting the pieces together.) Working in Critical Care throughout the pandemic (not just the Covid cases but the “lulls” in between each surge of severe alcohol withdrawal, overdoses, suicide attempts, and now the very sick who did not seek any care for the 2 1/2 years of the pandemic) along with an ongoing family conflict, has left me in a state of PTSD with sadness, hyper vigilance, hopeless, and despair. Trying to get out of my funk, i turned to this book. This book has explained so much on how past traumas, especially when they were not dealt with and you have not listened to your body or learned the word “No or the negative talk” yet as the book describes. Not until you hear it chapter by chapter and put the pieces together does the lightbulb go off. It made me think of and understand things from my childhood I didn’t realize were even in my conscious mind. Not just another book on stress for sure. It goes much deeper to understand why we process or not process what we do or how we are. Some reviews stated it was redundant and repetitive but I found each explanation slightly different between the body’s response to trauma, the psychological response, and the patient examples on just “ordinary” people living “ordinary” lives. This was my first experience with one of Dr. Matè’s books and it was eye-opening to say the least. I didn’t mind his son’s voice because I have not heard the author speak much and for long periods of time…yet.",3 people found this helpful,Gratitude. Can’t say I enjoyed it but I appreciate this book,"""Insightful, empowering. Research presented supports what I’d begun to suspect. One of the most important books I’ve read. Thanks Dr Maté.

The information provided on plant-based whole foods, including herbs and spices was informative and inspiring. Unfortunately, his ability to constantly bash even moderate consumption of anything from an egg to any kind of fish, meat or fowl really seems to have missed the current research on healthful eating. Many studies have shown that our government did us a disservice to stop eating egg yolks but he did point out that Eggbeaters is devoid of most benefits, as are many processed food substitutes. Lastly, his statements encouraging the eating of sugar and starch for pre-diabetic and diabetic people seems to border on medical malpractice. He references a 1927 study stating that people fed a diet high in carbs, especially sugar & starch dropped their blood sugar while anyone eating fat and animal protein spiked their sugar. In closing, read this book, take whatever is useful and incorporate it into your eating plan but also see through his religious fervor when it comes to eschewing any other complementary food choices that are acceptable to accompany your plant-based menu choices.

However, so much of the presentation felt overly simplified - most of the personal stories and example applications seemed to be reduced to a “you as a parent do A; your child will do B - and be saved from a life of disaster” equation. The advised approach was often framed more like a switch you can flip as a parent to gain the outcome you want, reducing real life with real kids to a formula, while the outcomes of not doing so often felt inflated and catastrophized (i.e., not having first-time obedience from your child on an instruction such as taking out the trash will result in an incapable adult). There also seemed to be a fair amount of judgement and condescension in the overall voice that distracted from the practical advice. One moment that stood out was the authors addressing truly serious topics like a child sharing thoughts on peer drug use, etc., and lumping in “ridiculous” requests like wanting to dye their hair blue alongside these issues. As a parent, I believe we do our children as much a disservice when we make small issues big as when we make big issues small; there were several moments like this where the authors’ personal taste seemed to outweigh the data on what are truly areas of concern. Additionally, moments like describing the neighbor of a hardworking single mom as advising the mom with “cigarette hanging out of her mouth” to seek public assistance so she “wouldn’t have to work so hard to take care of her kid” are an extremely insensitive and detrimental characterization of people in general, and single moms in particular, who need assistance as a part of their hard work and struggle to raise and steward their children well. On top of these moments, the descriptions of showing empathy in each interaction with your children fell absolutely flat, both because of the example wording and the narration. Starting nearly every conversation around a child’s disobedience, disappointment, or struggle with “Oh, that’s sad,” and ending with a version of, “if any kid can figure it out, you can” begins to feel like the old compliment/critique sandwich - more like a script than true engagement. The narrator’s style feels almost like delivery of lines in an old film - overly dramatic in both tone and pacing. All of these factors made the tone of this book, despite its good moments, feel like it was written many years ago rather than being a new release. There’s so much incredible brain science that’s been pioneered in the last several years; focusing on how truly taking care of our brains to build minds and bodies that equip our children for the best future possible, absent of all of these other inclusions that really prevent the takeaway of much of that brain health message, would make this book a much more valuable resource.",2 people found this helpful,,,,,,,

And in this book she delivers all her knowledge in a very profound yet comprehensive way. But, instead of writing only about grit and her researches, she goes beyond and talks about play, deliberate practice, flow and many other important topics of the psychology of success. I will try to highlight the message, but I recommend you to read the book at least once. Grit is a consistency of effort and practice. A gritty person have the attitude of never giving up, have an obsession and go for it, try to be the best in the world and always search for ways to improve; A gritty person has passion and perseverance. Having grit is better than having talent (but better to have both). To have grit is to have a laser bean focus (specially on your weaknesses) to achieve what you desire, to get feedback from others and from yourself and use it to make adjustments to be more competent.

I'm 54, and although I didn't feel obese, I was. In fact, according to weight charts, I was over 100 lbs. overweight. - The past five years, I've lost 40 lbs. on three separate occasions - only to gain all of the weight back each time. - Last November, I lost some weight, traveled to Italy, lost 10 more lbs. with all of the walking, then I returned to US and packed on 25 lbs. in a couple of months, but still 25 lbs. below my highest weight. - I needed to do something. I was sick of the yo-yo syndrome. I went online and found The Obesity Code. What an ugly name I thought, but I wanted to find a scientific approach - something that could explain to my what was going on. - As soon as I started listening Fung talks about fasting - that's the deal-breaker - I loathe it. - But something clicked. Paraphrasing Fung, Yes, you will feel hunger, but the hunger pangs will go away in 15 minutes... They did, In fact, I can now say I'm not even sure if it was hunger I felt. - I fasted one day a week a couple of weeks, then two days a week for two weeks, I'm confident I could easily fast for a week without any issues. In fact, it's been months since I fasted an entire day. WHAT WORKS FOR ME... - I do not snack. I believe this is major. Supposedly your body burns stored energy (fat) since there's no fuel in the tank (food/snacks). Also, I've lost major fat around my chest and gut. - Contrary to everything I have read, I eat at night. I fast the entire day, then eat around 6 pm to 8 pm. This works for me. Throughout the day, I'll drink coffee/tea/water/sparkling water. I do this four days a week, but FRI, SAT and SUN, I eat throughout the day. - I don't count calories. I eat well. I don't feel I'm on a diet. There are times I eat 4 or 5 pieces of chicken at night. I always drink wine - 1 or 2 glasses a night. I eat cheese, nuts, fruits, etc. I actually crave salads, something I wasn't used to. - I was fat for a reason. I love pastries; I love sweets. I'm avoiding sugars and wheat. I avoid sugars for obvious reasons. I avoid wheat because although I lost weight, I felt like I weighed 500 lbs., weighing half of that. My knees hurt when I got out of my car, so I read about inflammatory properties, etc., and in just two days, I had more bounce in my step. Plus, think about it, wheat is in bread, pastries, bagels, carb-concentrated foods, fortified carbs, etc. BUT, I do eat pasta, bread, and desserts when socializing. - I don't really exercise, although I try to walk a bit more throughout the day. According to my step counter on my iphone, I walk about 7,000 steps throughout the day. I purchased this audiobook less than a year ago, and it has been a life-changer. WHY AM I WRITING THIS REVIEW? As I was walking by a table at a restaurant, I overheard an acquaintance tell a friend, Man, your friend's really done a great job losing all of that weight. Boy, I felt good, but not goofy. What I'm doing is working. I expect to lose weight. Overall, I'd have to say that the three biggest factors contributing to my weight loss THAT WORK FOR ME are (and one is the byproduct of the other...): - Not Snacking - Fasting - Avoiding Sugars/Wheat except during social activities Recently, it was my daughter's wedding, and I wanted to try my suit on, just in case, and HOLY W#(&$!, I floated inside of it. I had to make a last-second run to Nordstrom and get a new suit. My wife is happy because she feels that I am healthier, and I of course I feel much better. IT HAS BEEN EASY. My barometer always was that I felt (was) the fattest guy in the room. I still am occasionally but it's definitely not as frequent. When I watch a documentary or movie about the Vikings, Saxons, etc., I think about how they marched all day, only to eat at nighttime. It's not like if they stopped by for a snack, plus there wasn't such a thing as a four-course meal. You ate, you drank, you slept, you got up, repeat. As Fung states, he couldn't find where this notion of eating three times a day come from, and now it's also snacks in between meals. Big money has really brainwashed us.

Parts were laugh-out-loud funny, while I was also brought to tears several times (and even once in any book is fairly rare for me). The level of empathy in describing the patients makes it almost impossible not to also empathize, and the psychological insights about both herself and her patients provide enough food for thought to make a re-listen worthwhile for that reason alone. The narration was pitch-perfect for storytelling and dialogue, and always with the right emotional resonance.

If you’ve been following his lectures on YouTube, you will hear many things in this book that you’ve heard before, and others you have not. I have only two criticisms; the first, and and the lesser of the two, is that he spends a bit too much time on some rather rambling personal stories for my taste. Peterson has so much to say of great importance, I find myself a bit bored with some of the extended stories of his growing up. The second criticism, the more substantial one, is that I would prefer he spend less time on the explanation of religious archetypes. While I find some of that interesting, I think it takes up too much of this book. Considering that there’s nothing in the title that would suggest a religious bent, I’m afraid it might turn some readers off. Those two exceptions aside, I enjoyed this book a lot.

Instead of treating patients when they're sick or broken, why not keep them healthier longer? I already was aware of a lot of the general information but this is a good synthesis, and Attia has a missionary zeal to help more people live better longer. I have two minor negative comments. First, Attia's a high achiever, which is great, and also a relentless name dropper. Got a little distracting. Second, I didn't expect it to be so much of a personal memoir. I'm glad he got some help for his own mental health, but I was less interested in how his workaholic over achieving temperament turned him into a raging jerk and landed him in residential treatment. I had listened to a podcast with Freakonomics author Steven Levitt and that included most of the relevant information, with less of the personal mea culpa from Attia. In summary, great data about nutrition, exercise and sleep, but unless you have a personal interest in his residential treatment, you can skip the chapter at the end about his emotional turmoil.",12 people found this helpful,Two best versions of Peter,"""I'm an avid listener of Audible but seldom write reviews, this one will be my first one, but I really felt compelled to write it as I was so grateful after reading it. I was initially quite unimpressed during the beginning of the book, which deployed several tactics already discussed elsewhere and in Peter's podcasts . In the beginning of the book found the chapter on stability the most useful. The first part of the book is Peter-mind-of-steel, the sharp, decisive, clear, assertive Peter. Nothing very new, though. The second part, as I would call, is Peter-heart-of-gold, where Peter exposes himself with a courage I never saw in other authors in the same genre. This second part is the jewel of the book, inspires and touches as Peter show immense courage to share his stories , his challenges, his deepest shadows and wounds, and his insights. And it shines light on the first part as well. I found the epilogue brilliant, bringing unity to the whole book, and the acknowledgement session is the best I have ever read.

And yet much like the results he promises, James Clear offers an outsized amount of payoff for your investment. The insights in this book are profound, actionable, and well presented. Other self help authors could learn from Clear’s no-nonsense approach. There is almost zero fluff, and yet it’s not an academic slog either. It reads smoothly, and the information is easy to understand and retain. In fact, if you forget some of the things you’ve learned, it’s such a well put together package that listening over and over is an option that demands little effort. Furthermore, Clear roots his observations in psychological studies and real-world examples that lend credibility to his advice. The data makes many of his points nearly unarguable. My only point of criticism would be that at times, the scientific certainty of his conclusions is somewhat overstated. A critical thinker will notice certain examples that seem overly simplistic in their application. After all, data can be ambiguous in many ways and anec dotes are even more questionable. This is a minor concern, because Clear is largely humble and well grounded in his claims. I have no doubt whatsoever that his advice, if heeded, will yield the promised results, and for such a brief and well done audio book, you will hardly find a better value for your money.",5 people found this helpful,Practical and motivating,"I've been a reader of James Clear's newsletter for the past two years and found the book a great reflection of his previous research on habits.

I like the mystery surrounded around the Hero. I like the Heroine's occupation, it isn't the usual occupation of a Heroine in a romance. I like the depth of character of the Hero. However, I detest the shallowness and immaturity of the Heroine. She is supposed to be an sensation in her career with more talent then anyone her age should have; she is 26. However, she acts like a 15 year old in her personal life. Instead of having an adult conversation with Jesse about her reluctance to start a relationship with him, she refuses to answer her phone or her door. She has co-workers lie about her presence at work. For God's sake, I wanted to yell at the Hero and tell him that this woman is not worth even 1/2 the effort he puts forth to win her. She has no ability to read between the lines and only cares about how she feels about something. She absolutely doesn't try to see things from any point of view other than her own; Good God! Her characters almost made me abandon the novel, completely! Then good parts helped me to continue, however. My only other issue is the narrator's male voice. It does not fit the described Hero, at all. They should have picked Sabacion York or someone like him.

The male voice for the audio was pretty bad - he had sexy voice, but was trying too hard (his voice was oddly airy sounding at times) and it was hard to understand him during some lines.",,Honestly very slay!,"This book took me off guard, the way this book talks about death and living is just so peaceful.

As a Weather Channel viewer, I liked Weathering the Storm for its unique take and Come On because it just starts off with a bang. Did you have an extreme reaction to this book? Did it make you laugh or cry? It made me laugh a few times, but even the funny stories had both sexiness mixed in with the naughtiness as well as tender moments. I like erotica that makes me feel like the characters care about what's going on and even when there were multiple partners (or even one partner) in this book, there was something more going on, which is saying something when they were all so short. Any additional comments? Some of these stories pushed my buttons in surprising ways but I can honestly say there were none I disliked.

I think Ward's powerful romances between the brothers and their love-interests in the first novels are a strong factor that drew me in to this series. While there was sexual attraction, there was a distinct lack of romance in the relationship between Tohrment (sp?) and Autumn (No'one). In fact, there were a few uncomfortable scenes where Thor treated her poorly, shows her his disdain, and repeatedly stated he wasn't in love with her. So much so that when he finally declares his love for her, it's unconvincing. I missed the posessiveness (MINE) and the bonding scent that was such a big part of the other brother's bonding with their mates. The motivation for the relationship between Tohr and Autumn (which I can't describe without spoilers) is another depressing aspect of the romance between the two. On the plus side, Ward is highly talented at writing fast-paced, multi-faceted stories and you will certainly be entertained for the 20+ hours of this recording. There is a secondary relationship story between John and Xhex that will keep you riveted as well. Many newer characters are being developed (Band of Bastards) and while I'm not yet emotionally invested in them, Ward has established some interesting teasers/plants that I expect will be nicely developed in future novels. And, as always, the narrator is fantastic!",23 people found this helpful,Where's the Romance?,"""I've followed the brotherhood for a while now, and I've been a devoted fan. I know many reading this will be fans, and I respect that. Aside from the obvious incongruity of warriors who are hundreds of years old talking like 17 year old street thugs, I've enjoyed the series. The trouble is, the last 5 books (with one exception) have been disappointments for me. This book, I'm afraid, put the nail in my BDB coffin. Without providing spoilers, it's hard to voice my complaints about this book, but I'll try. The romance is weak, and in the end, just didn't work for me. I considered Tohr's treatment of No'one for at least the first half of their relationship to be disrespectful at best and emotionally abusive at worst. The second half of their relationship only improved marginally until the very end. This fact was disturbing, but the fact that the rest of the brothers (and household, including No'one's son in law and her daughter) knew what was going on and no one bothered to even mention it, much less intervene, is massively disappointing. JR Ward, as is her usual style, carries on several story lines in this book, but none of them seem to advance the plot much. They do open up some interesting possibilities for future books, but that's about it. I've been debating whether or not I'll keep reading this series, but I think this will be the last one for me. I think I'll leave the in between now and step on into the fade.",17 people found this helpful,"One Word ""Love"".",,10 people found this helpful,,,,,,,

I have read some Jescie Hall before this one, but this just hit an entirely new level. The absolute hurt and anger the 2 MCs deal with throughout this entire book, and the drug use.

Hawke wanted to help him get clean and on the right track. Hon, Jo, Johanna, depending on who is talking to her or about her, is Nicole's (Cole, Nic) sister. This takes place after a traumatic event in the sister's lives. It's pretty much instant attraction when Kid sees her for the first time at a club. Then they find out who each other is.

This story, like every other in this series, is awesome in its complexities. The way it weaves itself together through the POVs of the different characters whose eyes we get a chance to see the story unfold through, draws you in and holds on to you all the way through to the very last word. As for the audiobook aspect of it, I have to say that I have never really liked the narrator for this series. He doesn't have very many differences in his voice inflections and what he does have he doesn't always use properly. Unfortunately, a wonderful voice (I'm sure that's why he was chosen originally) does not a wonderful narrator for every story make. No matter how awesome the tenor of his voice, when he tries to come across all hip and with it, this narrator mostly just ends up sounding like a major dweeb… True! However, the mediocre narration, coupled with the horrible editing job by the sound person that is supposed to prevent the issues this audiobook has, leaves us with a very irritating narrative that has weird pauses and sometimes no pauses at all, missing words/sentences and a definite sense that this book would absolutely be better when read the old-fashioned way.",1 person found this helpful,KINGS PUT TO THE TEST!,"""While Lover Avenged focused mostly on Rehvenge, there seems to be a lot of avenging going on in here, and it seems to only end with the promise of more too come.

Their plan to ruin Adam's reputation, and thus his hypocritical father's reputation, involved filming fake sex tapes and releasing them online. As this fake relationship develops, Adam and Sage begin to realize that they need each other and challenge each other in deep, emotional ways.

If you thought those other books might have been boarderlining on content that made you feel uncomfortable, then I'd encourage you to try this one. I did not think that this book was as spicy as those. This audiobook was incredible! This duet style narration is performed by Vivienne LaRue and Jacob Morgan.

Definitely worth the credit.",,Story came around!,"At first, I just couldn't handle this book. Yes, I was excited to find out what happened with Poppy and Tyler after the first book, but at first it was really hard for me to wrap my mind around this storyline. I kept thinking what married couple fucks this much?. Maybe it's because I'm a full time marriage counselor, but the way the relationship was first portrayed was really hard for me to believe. When you have a book about married people, there needs to be a little bit more about the emotional connection between two people who share their lives together, the good and the bad, the pretty and the ugly..... I understand that it's an erotica and romance book, but married love is more about the many layers of connection that just the sex. Emotional connection can coexist with physical, lusty and hot sex. It was bothersome that Tyler was so insecure and jealous, and he would over think things if poppy resisted having sex one night because she was busy working. It seemed like his only skill to reconnect was to have dirty raw sex with her. His mind was filled with jealousy and insecurity and his only option ever to recover from his guilt and his feelings for this was to fuck her brains out. Anytime Poppy would show that she needed some emotion, that she showed sadness his only thought to help her would be to stick his fingers inside of her at the dinner table or force her on her hands and knees or make her give him road head on a trip or make her have sex with him in her childhood bed. I felt that if he really wanted to connect with her he should try listening to her they should talk and maybe just hold each other. It's frustrating that his only option is to have sex with her in every way to dominate her and as he calls it possess her and claim her instead of just trying to listen to her and be emotionally there for her.... Until later, then the book shifted, he finally seemed to understand married love. Genuinely being there to care for her heart and soul and not just her body. The things they went through transformed him into a real husband to her. I even got tearful as their story became tragic and Tyler was an emotional strength for Poppy. It really started to feel like a real connection formed between them that I truly loved and appreciated!

I absolutely love Lucky who is played by JF Harding. Teddy Hamilton as Jasper is something I didn’t realize I needed in my life. OMG Jason Clarke as Jaykob is what dreams are made of. Avery Caris as Eden is spectacular. Thank you so much Rebecca.",1 person found this helpful,Great story and amazing cast!!,"""This had me hooked from the beginning, I absolutely loved it and the cast was absolutely phenomenal!!

Each of these men are unique and bring their own twist to the story that had me on the edge of me seat (and clenching my thighs) While there was LOTS of smut and spice there was also and interesting story, lots of humor and a bit of heart and soul. Lucky - Absolutely the comic relief Dom - The Grump and fearless leader Jasper - The voice of reason and logic Beau - The healer, both medically and emotionally Jayk - The closed off brute with a heart of gold buried deep down (maybe really deep but it’s there) How could Eden possibly choose?

This was my first Jescie Hall book and it certainly won't be my last. Hawke had me in a choke hold from the very beginning and didn't let go until well after I finished. I'm not one for a cheating trope... But there was something about the way this story was told that had me not give any flying effs about fidelity. I couldn't wait for Cole to give her boyfriend the boot, but understood why she couldn't which helped me justify it in my mind, along with him treating her so poorly. The audio was amazing. A duet narration with Avery Caris and Joe Arden that was seamlessly produced by Blue Nose Audio. I got so sucked into their acting, especially Joe's. He was just incredible as Hawke, you could feel so much emotion from him. This story was less dark (still dark, check your triggers) and more emotional than I expected.

Olivia from the very start of meeting her new brother as children wants to love him and make him feel special. Malachi is a little bit different due to circumstance and is selective mute - and dealing with ASPD. He is obsessed with Olivia from the start. She is the only kind person to him in the world. Onto the audio - one of my favorite things about this is the fact that Joe Arden literally sounds like he is signing as he is speaking when in the parts of the book he’s talking to anyone, for me that was just phenomenal. His inner monologue, his signing and actual speech are so distinguishable between the 3. It’s just extraordinary. Malachi story broke my heart, and that was 100% because Joe makes you believe it.

It’s extremely DARK and has some taboo elements (foster siblings relationship, dubcon, violence, stalking, etc) that might be too much for the casual listener. The performances from both Heather Firth and Joe Arden are A+++ here. Arden in particular delivers so much raw and desperate emotion as Malachi. I was hanging on his every word for the entirety of his POV. So glad we got to hear this as a duet too so we could get each narrator speaking their own lines even in the other’s POV.

There was a lot of tragedy and intrigue, in this book. There was also a few scenes of sexual assault, although they were not described in detail. There were a lot of good characters that lost their lives, or the lives of their loved ones. In addition, this book demonstrated the ugliest parts of humanity; which reflected our current world, in many ways.

Some of the explanations of the book’s objects in their attempts to instill the importance of a game are too hyperbolic (many uses of ‘of all time’) or use debunked game history stories such as the shortage of yen coins following Space Invaders launch in Japan. There are some memorable stories about donors relationship with the Strong Museum such as anecdote about the Her interactive Nancy Drew series.

Some are better than others, and sometimes you just find the one that clicks for you. For me, this was that book! Jessica Brody's analysis of novel story structure breaks down major points in the novel and shows that whether you're writing a YA fantasy or a slice of life, there is a commonality in those stories that keep us reading way after we should have been asleep. Specific examples are given across multiple genres which helps to cement the ideas presented and show how they are applicable to any writer who wants to convey a compelling and well-paced narrative or add depth to a hero who might feel a little 2D. The audiobook comes with a 50 page PDF with questions designed to help you implement the Save the Cat! structure, in-depth breakdowns of popular stories like Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone and Girl on a Train to illustrate the points, and other great tips on pacing, loglines, and the universal lessons that are the foundations of almost every story. I did enjoy Jessica Brody's narration of the book, and always think that having the author read it creates a nice connection to the material. Save the Cat!

I use the Learn Spanish Like an M.F. program by the same author as my main, core Spanish program to learn Spanish actively, whenever I have the time. And during my downtime or in my sleep I use this one. But in my opinion, this audio program can also be used as someone's core learning-Spanish program.

It allows me to learn passively while I am focused on another task like driving to work or working out in the gym. But what I find most brilliant about this audiobook is that it makes use of brown noise and allows me to learn Spanish while I am sleeping.

Josh has incredible passion for chess and martial arts. This came across in his reading and it is what makes this memoir memorable and inspiring. What did you like best about this story? This really isn't a book with a story. rather a memoir of his life experiences and what he learned from that. There is a complication to this that needs to be overcome by the listener. Josh is beyond brilliant and dedicated. His approach probably shares characteristics with savants and obsessive compulsive driven individual. this is not to diminish his incredible accomplishments but the listener needs to reconcile this. As an avid average amateur athlete and marital artists I identified with what Josh discussed. But it is simply not possible to put some of his approaches into practice. I personally do not posses that level of talent. However it is an inspirational memoir that resonated with me and I took a lot away from listening to it. Which character – as performed by Josh Waitzkin – was your favorite? Josh. He is a remarkable person. I found it fascinating that he was able to be successful at such a young age and be a fully functional What did you learn from The Art of Learning that you would use in your daily life? Ultimately I thought the memoir was a study in the practical applications of Buddhist thought. Define your own path, nurture it and dedicate your self to its perfection. In this way I found the ideas presented inspirational to myself as a martial artist and amateur athlete. Any additional comments? I would recommend this book since the concepts could be applied to anybody in any walk of life. Whether you are trying to be a better parent, student or professional there are ways you can focus and learn how to develop your personal skill set. This is a short book, but I am glad I read it.",26 people found this helpful,Fantastic and inspiring!,"""Absolutely loved it! Josh is a great storyteller and this book is evident of that! Definitely something that inspires me to continue to cultivate my love of learning!",1 person found this helpful,A deep look at the repeated journey to mastery,"While Josh does not break the book down into clear cut tips for success, he does dive deep into his journey of learning. His focus on changing learning for your own style is consistent with how the story is told. This is a wonderfully told story of two separate journeys to mastery and the lessons learned along the way. how those lessons crossed the border between chess and taichi and how different players in his life affected the journey.

Among the best! Cialdini has distilled his science into a magnum opus. Many years after his seminal book Influence he has taken the science of social psychology to a new level. What was one of the most memorable moments of Pre-Suasion? His skilled writing presents complex facts in a compelling and memorable way. For instance, when describing what attracts our attention, Cialdini categorizes them as the Sexual, the Threatening, and the Different..... given the acronym that forms, it makes an excellent example of itself. Throughout the book his prose exemplifies the style and power of the communication skills he shares. Have you listened to any of John Bedford Lloyd’s other performances before? How does this one compare? Nope but he does a good job of emphasizing the relevant words and as far as I can tell hasn't mispronounced any. Thumbs up! Any additional comments? This book is not for beginners, it's a masterclass. Employing arcane psychological concepts like priming, memory biases and manipulation of attention seem intended for professionals and people with a psychology or persuasion background. If you haven't read Cialdini's first book, Influence, along with some basic psychology literature, this book may be hard to understand, or even accept.

Took it multiple times in school but very little stuck. I bought this program hoping it would be helpful and surprisingly it is one of the best I’ve used thus far. The lessons are easy but not simple. They are long enough without being too long so you don’t get overwhelmed or bored. And they stick to things that a relevant up front. If I skip a day I go back and listen to the prior lesson again on a fasted speed and see if I can keep up. If not, I repeat the lesson at the normal pattern and continue on. Sometimes I just repeat the lessons to get a better grasp. I like that they weave in prior learning to current lessons so as to keep reminding you along the way. That along with the vocabulary seems to be doing the job.

We start out with 3 laws of the “most engaging and persuasive presentations:” \t*Emotional –Touch My Heart \t*Novel- Teach Me something New \t*Memorable- Present Content in Ways I’ll Never Forget I first read Gallo’s book 10 Simple Secrets of the World’s Greatest Business Communicators in 2005. That book helped me improve my speaking with such practical and easy to apply tips that everyone noticed my improvement immediately. He had me when he said something I have always agreed with. When I would attend a seminar or training session and a new speaker would begin, I would always begin with a groan: oh no, more dumb jokes. Brain science now knows that we decide within a few seconds if the speaker is credible and if we are going to pay attention to him/her. That’s where the TED talks come in. They all start in the middle of the speech! They get right to the most interesting part of their topic and work backwards or sideways! How can you NOT listen! So after studying all these great speeches, Gallo comes up with 10 commonalities, aka Secrets, that I can apply immediately. He talks about using my passion for a topic, developing the ability to tell an intriguing story, internalize and rehearse my content paying attention to my vocal delivery, developing a catchy, current title, delivering a jaw-dropping moment, keeping even serious content light so the brain can remember and digest it, the importance of timing, painting a mental picture in the mind of your audience, narrowing your topic and how rehearsing develops authenticity.

With her knowledge of law and the investigative methods of a history professor as well as a journalist, Jill Lepore continuously asks the question, “Where did this come from and why do people use it and believe it?” She doesn’t hide her emotional response to events and statements, which I think makes her more believable.

And in this book she delivers all her knowledge in a very profound yet comprehensive way. But, instead of writing only about grit and her researches, she goes beyond and talks about play, deliberate practice, flow and many other important topics of the psychology of success. I will try to highlight the message, but I recommend you to read the book at least once. Grit is a consistency of effort and practice. A gritty person have the attitude of never giving up, have an obsession and go for it, try to be the best in the world and always search for ways to improve; A gritty person has passion and perseverance. Having grit is better than having talent (but better to have both). To have grit is to have a laser bean focus (specially on your weaknesses) to achieve what you desire, to get feedback from others and from yourself and use it to make adjustments to be more competent.

Most importantly, the author explains the huge gap between human intelligence and all present AI models. She warns us not to fear sci-fi scenarios about super intelligent computers taking over the world.

Certainly Kevin Mitnick, the author/protagonist is not by any means a heroic character. While he asserts he never hacked for financial gain in spite of the fact that he possessed huge amounts of credit card and other personally identifiable information the fact remains that he stole intellectual property, personal identities, telephone connectivity, etc. He needed to be caught and incarcerated, which in fact did occur. To him hacking was an addiction, an irresistible urge to beat the system, break through locked doors and unlock security measures designed to defeat him and people like him. Whether or not the listeners of this book believe he is rehabilitated or remorseful, the fact remains that he served time in prison and paid his debt to society. For me, the value of this book is that it illustrates just how dependent we all are on information systems, and how vulnerable we are to the lax security at the gatekeepers of our most personal information. We need to do a lot better, and hopefully Mr. Mitnick is now helping us as opposed to hacking us. I found the book engaging from a technical standpoint while it demonstrates just how easy it is for some to steal information, sometimes merely for the asking. As Mitnick stated, like taking candy from a baby.",3 people found this helpful,Learn From Successful People,"""Some Audible reviewers dislike that Kevin Mitnick in his book “Ghost in the Wires” is repetitive “every hack seems to be the same” and that the book celebrates immoral behavior “breaking the law”.

Many of her explanations are somewhat obvious, but she covers more complex objects and systems with a surprising ability to convey the essence of how something works without becoming ensnared with details that would be too tedious for most readers to follow. As an engineer, I tend to explain in too much detail, only sometimes realizing it is time to back off when seeing my audience glazing over. It seems few are as interested in the fine details as I am :-) Of course, to make our machines function, we must acknowledge that the devil is in the details, and we can't gloss over them. But when explaining these things, it is important to convey the main concepts, and it is OK to leave some details for the student to sort out. Roma took me deeper than I had seen before in several cases, and I learned some interesting things. But, even when the subject was somewhat mundane, and I fully understood it, Roma's clear and articulate voice was pleasant to follow, even when I had to interpret some English pronunciations that are quite foreign to this American.

I now have a more complete understanding of the structure of the field and the technical framework it’s built on, as well as the what the technology can and so far cannot do for us. Equally of interest are the questions about human society that the book raises. Can we succeed at aligning AI’s goals with our own if we don’t really understand what our own goals are? Christian describes the current ideas for how this may be possible, as well as the ways in which AI has so far been highlighting moral questions that we didn’t even realize we were confused about. The amount of research that went into this book is astounding - Christian draws from interviews with the top figures in every aspect of the field.

If it wasn't clear on 2005, it's certainly clear today that machine learning, deep learning, neutral nets, transformers, and other AI technologies (great courses on all of these at pyimagesearch.com btw) prove we will successfully reverse engineer the brain. Then exceed it. However, since 2005 we've learned that our intelligence does not solely come from our brain. About half of hydrocephalic patients with >95% of their brain replaced with cerebrospinal fluid, have IQs greater than 100. One student with greater than 97% of a normal brain replaced with cerebrospinal fluid, had an IQ of 126, was socially normal, and graduated with honors with a degree in mathematics. How could be do that without the neural connections, data storage, and processing power Ray describes? We have no idea. But it proves that the brain alone is not the source of human intelligence and so reverse engineering it won't create the greater than human level intelligence necessary for the singularity. Terminal lucidity, Alzheimer patients whose brains haven't functioned for years suddenly becoming completely coherent days or hours before death is another proof that there's more to intellect than a functioning brain.",2 people found this helpful,,,,,,,

It's all here. Sure, I have a degree in psychology and am very interested in human behavior, nature vs. nurture, and how our childhood affects us in adulthood. But this book is not for psychology buffs, it is for everybody. It is the story of how Elon Musk rose to where he is today, why he is so future-oriented when so many of the successful business wizards are living greedily in the present, and where Elon hopes to be going. Along the way, you will learn a great deal about his companies--his early successes and experiences all the way up to his current day successes, the trials and errors, and what we might expect in the future. You see those Tesla cars on the freeway and all you think about is how expensive they are. You hear about Space-X launches and wonder why you should be interested.

I thought I knew about the people who have shaped the digital revolution, but I did not know half of the detail contained in this book. It is detail that can bring history to life or bog it down. Some authors can bore you with details. Others just have the knack for telling a story in detail and making the story enjoyable. I particularly found it interesting how the attitude, motives and methods of the mother of Ada of Lovelace in providing for the education of her daughter laid a foundation for the computer revolution to come more than 100 years later. I listened to this book while taking a daily four mile walk. This book is so good that I wanted to keep on walking each day. Jim Fuqua",1 person found this helpful,Fascinating Review of Technology,"This is the book Isaacson was writing that was interrupted by his very fine biography on Steve Jobs. Although a bit long and tedious at some points, the book provides a really interesting history of the development of computers and digital technology. It's amazing how far ahead of their time some of these people were. A description of a computer demonstration from1968 is amazing--at least 30 years ahead of its time. The stories are interesting, but the author's main point is that most technology does not develop as a result of a solitary inventor in a garage, but as a result of collaborative efforts that build on the work of others. His discussion of the tension between closed and open systems--which is weaved throughout the book--is very interesting. As so today we have Apple and Google. A good read. Could have been a bit shorter.",1 person found this helpful,,,,,,,

He’s a blue collar worker’s billionaire, which is to say, everyday people like Musk. The story is mostly favorable, which causes it to come off like Musk had commissioned Isaacson to write it. That being said, Isaacson can’t help but let his political positions when documenting Musk’s occasional interaction with political matters. At these junctures, Isaacson goes into limousine liberal autopilot and portrays Musk as a conspiracy theorist, instead of the libertarian that he is. As a result, the unavoidable failure is Isaacson’s inability to check his political ideology at the door. This is the single greatest criticism of this biography. Otherwise I have thoroughly enjoyed this piece.",1 person found this helpful,,,,,,,

Don't be thrown by the violent chapters. I am of the opinion you don't even need them. The real story is in the remainder of the chapters, following Patrick Bateman around 80's NYC as he attempts to fit in, and hold it together. It sounds crazy, but if you're familiar with that time and place (or just the 80's at all), the book is absolutely hysterical. The reader does a great job with this, IMO. Small mistakes here and there, but absolutely nails the tone the entire way through. Highest possible recommendation.",1 person found this helpful,,,,,,,

Okay, so it's only been out there what, 50 years? How'd I miss this thing. I thought I read it as a kid and kept blowing past it on lists to read. Did I say it's as good as it gets? Who cares if a few things here and there didn't make any sense. It was funnier'n shit. What praise could I possibly add that hasn't already been heaped on and said in the last half century. How 'bout a few memorable quotes: Let's get the Fundamentalists out of the way: ‘The flag of that church will be blue and gold,’ said Rumfoord. ‘These words will be written on that flag in gold letters on a blue field: Take Care of the People, and God Almighty Will Take Care of Himself.” “To us of the Church of God the Utterly Indifferent, there is nothing more cruel, more dangerous, more blasphemous that a man can do than to believe that - that luck, good or bad, is the hand of God!” or There is no reason why good cannot triumph as often as evil. The triumph of anything is a matter of organization. If there are such things as angels, I hope that they are organized along the lines of the Mafia. How 'bout one for the minimalists: Every passing hour brings the Solar System forty-three thousand miles closer to Globular Cluster M13 in Hercules— and still there are some misfits who insist that there is no such thing as progress. A couple of classic Kurt that I hope will live forever: I want to stay as close to the edge as I can without going over. Out on the edge you see all kinds of things you can't see from the center. Say what you will about the sweet miracle of unquestioning faith, I consider a capacity for it terrifying and absolutely vile! I thoroughly enjoy Kurt Vonnegut's humor but I love him for his humanism; humanism that comes through on almost every page.

This one is really a joy, and together with Theft By Finding is a fabulous look into the mind of an author I would love to be like, love to meet. But in addition to that, this book and Theft By Finding give me the impression that we could be friends, perhaps should be.

The completeness of integrating an RPG game with real life has been readily managed by the author, Aleron Kong. Now, combine that with the talents of Nick Podehl, and you truly have an epic on your hands. He brings to life all of the characters in such a clever manner that I find it hard NOT to laugh at times, thanks to his way of expressing what is actually happening. Congrats to Aleron for injecting common day events and sayings into the script, so that Nick can expertly interpret them in voice. As a gamer, and a listener of these books, there were many times I'd think, This is what he's got to do now! as we've found ourselves gaming with these events happening to our avatars. Usually, these are basic moves ... or, what we consider to be the most logical moves, as we've probably repeated them over and over and over ... again. Aleron Kong goes beyond the rote next move and weaves an intricate, yet refreshingly correct, path for our hero. One that I've consistently found interesting. The moves are correct, because our hero is flawed and doesn't always go with the flow. It's unique. It's gripping.

The story was filtered by the point of view of the regular guys on an irregular adventure. They didn't bother trying to explain everything. They figured out what they needed to know, and went with it. It was an interesting premise, a good story, and a very good performance. Thorne's performance fit the characters perfectly, in all their imperfect glory. Any additional comments?

Everything! Any additional comments? If you have not read anything by Fredrik Backman, you are missing one of the freshest and most delightful voices in literary fiction. A Man Called Ove immediately joined my special book lists when I read it earlier this year. Not only did it make my Best of 2016 list, but my One of the Best Ever list and on to the ultimate, Books That Live in My Heart. So, it was with great anticipation and relish that I began My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She's Sorry. Just as with Ove, it took me a few chapters to hit my reading stride, but then I was swept up into the world of this book. Once again, Backman has given us a cast of very real and unforgettable characters. The tiny protagonist, 7 year old Elsa enjoys a special relationship with her Granny, a retired physician who is an unabashedly independent spirit. Just before Granny dies, she sets Elsa on an amazing journey through the magical world she shared with Elsa which leads her one by one, to the unusual inhabitants of the building where Elsa lives. As their stories unfold, Elsa discovers just how amazing Granny truly was. I read and listened to this book using the Kindle and Audible versions. I preferred listening as the voice of Joan Walker breathes life into each character in that way that a truly gifted narrator can. Just as when I read Ove, I closed my eyes, holding my Kindle to my chest and savored that special moment of completion of something as near to perfect as it can be. Britt-Marie Was Here, Backman's latest novel, connects to this book as Britt-Marie is an inhabitant of the building as well. It sits waiting for me to enjoy, but I may wait because when it is read, there aren't any others as yet.",2 people found this helpful,Another good story on humanity,"""I loved Fredrick Backman's A Man Called Ove. And this is another really good story by Backman about life and what breaks us and what heals us. Also, there's a little girl learning about growing up and that all people have their own particular story. I love Backman for his really great character development. The fairytales were a form of flashback and - while entertaining - weren't always woven in smoothly. I like the narrator. Her voices are lovely. The one issue that became s big issue is that her volume changes dramatically. If a narrator is whispering after talking loudly, it's really difficult to adjust the volume. I don't like the volume hurting my ears when there's normal talking and it's frustrating to rewind because the narrator is emphasizing by speaking softly.",2 people found this helpful,Magical,,1 person found this helpful,,,,,,,

Actor/comedian/writer/art collector/banjo picker/magician Steve Martin details his journey from aspiring young magician to the biggest comedian of all time (he was the first comedian to sell out 45,000 seat venues). You’ll find out that his overnight success took ten years and only then happened when he decided to go his own path. Despite the frequent bookings on the Tonight Show, fame and headliner status eluded him for a long time. He’d been demoted to performing only on guest host nights for a long period because Johnny wasn’t in to his act. When he slowly found his way, Johnny became his biggest fan. I sat down with this book to just read a chapter and couldn’t put it down. I read the whole thing in one sitting. I’m getting the audiobook next. It’s an amazing story of how a performer struggled and grew in his art. It’s the best analysis I’ve ever read of what it takes to be an original and how hard it can be to get acceptance for that.

I like Tina Fey generally, but I'm not a big fan of 30 Rock so I wasn't sure about the book. (for the record, I think the story lines are ridiculous, I think Alec Balwin is slightly annoying and I many of the 30 Rock jokes make me feel slightly uncomfortable.) I didn't think this book had any of the problems that 30 Rock has. Tina Fey seemed a bit neurotic but mostly just funny. I like her sarcastic take on most things (exception being: She seems pretty amazed by Alec Baldwin in a way I don't get). I was listening to the audiobook (earphones), in part, while my daughter napped. I laughed out loud several times and was actually worried that I'd wake her. Like I said, I particularly laughed at some of the times she talked about being a working mom and the pressures of being a mom (working or otherwise) in society today. This stuff always gets me, because I found the first 6 months of motherhood to be really hard and I like hearing from otherwise successful people who also had a hard time. Especially if they make it seem ridiculous that other people made you feel bad then. yeah. anyway, its pretty short. You should probably read it. the book generally had some pretty right-on moments that I haven't heard before. It wasn't heavily SNL, 30 Rock or even feminist (I wouldn't have minded the former or the latter). I kept feeling that she concisely poked at a bit of truth over and over again, in a way that was light, funny and real.",12 people found this helpful,The Fey Pride Parade,"""There is so much to love about this memoir, which anyone who's interested in what it's really like to work your way up through the ranks of television comedy should find very illuminating, but I have to give particular kudos to the book for two reasons: 1. As a gay reviewer, I found Fey's portrait of her many young gay friends figuring out their sexual identity's a nice combination of funny, sensitive and honest. The time in a gay person's life when he/she has either figured out their sexuality but not had sex or started experimenting sexually but is not sure what it means for their identity can be very confusing. The fact that Fey both manages to create portraits of these young people that both point out their foibles while acknowledging why they might be so en-foibled (yes, I made up that term) is like a successful high-wire act that incorporates a chair and a dog. 2. Apropos of Audible, this is DEFINITELY a book that's worth hearing in the audio format, even if you've read it already. Fey's intonations, imitations and inflections are not only super-enjoyable if you're a Tina Fey fan but also add a richness to the text that's characteristic of writers who have experience writing for performers. It is a testament to my parents that they never reacted negatively to the 4 year Pride parade that marched through their home. -Tina Fey, Bossypants",10 people found this helpful,"Read the book, and STILL LOVED the audiobook!",,6 people found this helpful,,,,,,,

I was dissapointed that so much of the book was previously published in The New Yorker though. I enjoyed the story about his father's inappropriate behavior. I know that's horrible to say, but I've been reading his books since he was just breaking out in the 90s, and while he is a master of self depreciation, I've always sensed huge intentional gaps about his family dynamic. Obviously, the family has a right to their privacy, so I truly appreciate his willingness to share such difficult topics with us all. I miss stories about his mother.

I enjoy her stories immensely.",23 people found this helpful,If only I could tell a story like that,"""It is so enjoyable to listen to David Sedaris tell stories. Some people might find him offensive but if anyone’s honest with themselves they know they think the same way… Sick and twisted from time to time. I hope he takes it as a compliment. The only thing that made me feel a bit bummed out was that I had listen to a bunch of his talkshow and podcast appearances before listening to his books and the stories do repeat so lesson learned… But this is also my first book of his that I have read/listened to so if I go back to the beginning and read some of his early work I’m sure I will be delighted through and through",2 people found this helpful,"His best yet. Funny, dark, thoughtful.","This collection of stories are easily some of my favorites. Funny, touching, heartbreaking, enlightening. Moving through family laughs, dysfunction, abuse, and love, David Sedaris speaks to so much of what so many of us understand. There are cringey stories and stories that help frame some of the horrible events we all endured during the pandemic. He also walks us through his experience grieving the death of his father, who had somewhat of a transformation near the end of his life. This not uncommon theme - abusive young father to loving elderly father - is thoughtfully explored. Each topic in the book is truly well crafted with his trademark acerbic humor cutting right through the darkest moments. I enjoyed every minute spent listening to this book.",1 person found this helpful,,,,,,,

Got what I paid for here.",,narrator and plot,I love Margaret Atwood's The handmaid's Tale and the Testaments! this short story is supposed to take somewhere in the time after the handmaid's tale when Gilead is overthrown? you don't have the time reference it's very speculative. Margaret doesn't tell what these women did in the past so trying to get a sense of time is very hard. this is very bad! Margaret Atwood has written several books besides the handmaid's Tale in the Testaments. I feel that this short story Falls flat on its face. I believe this short story could have been written better and put in a book of anthologies because I know this book was only a dollar 39 to buy it or one credit. if you bought it for one credit this is a very bad disappointment so I was cautious and I bought it only for $1. 39 because a credit can be worth up to any book price. I know Margaret Atwood can write better than this or was this some writer that was ghosting for Margaret Atwood and really didn't know her style. listen to it if you want but don't use your credit buy it for 1.39 and then forget about the book because this is not a Gilead story it doesn't relate to it if I could return this book I'm going to because this book really sucks.,,,,,,,,

At first it seems slightly comic, almost like Maria Semple's Where'd you go Bernadette.

I have read many books recently where I realize halfway through that, however strong the plot, I just don't care about the characters. I felt protective of Eleanor from the very beginning. Ms. Honeyman builds such a strong impression of Eleanor that the reader is compelled to take the journey with her. We laugh, but only gently, at her misunderstanding of her fellow humans.

I read an abridged version of Catch-22 decades ago and thought it was okay. The true madness and beauty of the work can only be fully appreciated in the multiple overlapping viewpoints of the unabridged version. While you do not have to have a military background to appreciate the insanity of the circumstances, it helps. And while an absolutely masterful satirical work, so many of the scenarios ring home so true. As a young enlisted Marine I became painfully aware of the silly games those with rank play in order to fulfill their obligation to follow orders no matter how ridiculous. Now, dealing on a daily basis with Air Force culture where people do ridiculous stuff not even knowing why they do it and never questioning it because to do so would suggest one is not a team player, Heller perfectly captures a culture that still exists 60 years after the writing. The upshot is that a measure of insanity is natural and necessary in a business which exists only for the sake of killing with discipline. No one could be truly sane and do what needs to be done in the profession of arms, and Heller captures that truth magnificently.",43 people found this helpful,One of the most entertaining books I’ve read,"""and the reading was superb as well!

It’s understandable how important this book was to the US counterculture of the time. And still is today given current trends in American political life. As for the performance: incredible!

They all had their own unique personalities and struggles and the story gave just enough time to each of them, as well as a nice sprinkling of other tertiary (but still compelling) characters. It provided a good mix of character development and murder plotting, which is hard to find in modern murder mystery/crime stories. I also loved that the book gave us a solid introduction to McMasters and then changed pace to focus on the “theses” of these three characters. In the end, the book allows us to relish a bit in the satisfaction of sweet revenge while tempering that out with the consequences of taking another human life. I was very happy with the way the story concluded.

In other words, he has a very peculiar sense of humor, but if you find it funny you will be laughing to hard that people will be staring at you on the subways. Now, I listened to a version of the book prior to the release of the 2005 movie, so I don't know if this new version of the book by random house audio is the same or if it has been modified for the movie.

True I do have a warped sense of humor, or at least those who know me would claim. Which may explain my passion for all of Douglas Adams books. Nonetheless, I am looking forward to listening to this book, and after that I'm off to see the movie, well maybe not the movie.

If you've never heard the original radio show, do yourself a favor and go find it, because there's nothing quite like it; but if you're looking for a straightforward (no sound effects, etc.) yet brilliant (and delightfully British) reading of the book version, this is it.

Since you can get these five books for one credit, go ahead and get it, instead of one book at a time. Believe me if you buy the first book, you are going to want the second and if you buy the second, etc. Since this is five books I will go over each, in case you buy one at a time. I will try an be brief. I mean if if takes you as long to read the review as the book, why not just get the book. 1, The Sword and The Stone (1938). This is the best of the five and is mostly a fantasy. Wart/Arthur is turned into several animals to learn about life. There is also an interesting part on boar hunting. Did you know on a boar spear there is a cross piece to keep the animal from running up the spear to get to you. 2.The Witch In the Wood (1939) This is shorter, darker and not as funny, nor as good as the book before and after, but necessary as it explains the origin of the Round Table. 3. The Ill-Made Knight (1940) This is all about Lancelot. You really get to know his character, matter of fact there is more character building in this book then the others. This is the longest of the books and actually goes on about three hours longer then it should have. Did you know that Lancelot was extremely ugly? This is one of the reasons he became such a great Knight. It is such a big part of his character I can't believe so many movies chose to make him some stupid Handsome Hunk. He is a lot more complicated as an Ugly Man. You are introduced to the tragic character Elaine, who starts out as a trickster, but who you end up feeling strongly sorry for. Guinvere turns out to be one horny queen. 4. The Candle in The Wind (1958) Does Might Mean Right is the common theme in all these books. It is especially in this one and the book has several long speeches. I myself as a child never understood why John Wayne won ever fight he was in. Until True Grit, John Wayne strongly believed he should never be killed in a movie. Heroes don't die and never lose fights. King Arthur's mother dies at the age of 70, in bed with a young man she seduced. In the original Once and Future King this was the last book, as it should have stayed. 5.The Book of Merlyn (1977) This was published after T.H. White's death. He wanted it in the original (Once and Future King), but the editor would not allow it. That was one smart editor. This book brought the whole series down from Five stars to Four. This book has no plot and is 97% anti-war speeches. There is a part where the King is turned into a ant and then into a goose. Those parts and the end which explains what finally happens to everybody are the only good parts to the book. This is mostly a debate where White argues both sides. I also am aniti-war, but no explanation is given about what to do about people like Hitler. White seems to say let him keep murdering Jews. All in all this is very well written, is very entertaining and if you are a fan of the Legend of Arthur, then it is a must read. The narrator is excellent.",108 people found this helpful,Buy it for the first book.,"""The narration in this story is outstanding! I thoroughly enjoyed the first book and was pleased to learn how true to the story Disney's The Sword in the Stone movie acutally was. The rest of the story focuses the affair between Lancelot and Guinevere. The moments when Arthur comes into the story are touching and my favorite parts, but they are few and far between. There are also several great side stories along the way that make it worth reading. The final book, as others have said is completely different. It doesn’t really add anything to the story. It’s interesting, but only if you are really into sociopolitical theory, anthropology, and biology. That doesn’t make sense to you? Give it a try and see what I mean.",18 people found this helpful,Best Narration,,1 person found this helpful,,,,,,,

Okay, Book Two of this series is still my favorite. But The Dark Secret has a good lot of merits, too. For one thing, there's Starflight's character development. And the matter of Starflight's parentage gave me one gleeful smile and two horrified face-contortions - you know, just like the other dragonets' did! Then we have the adorable quirks of nearly every dragonet on full display, which really is Tui Sutherland's strength. The resolution made me happy (I ship two entire tribes now - why not!) and the Alternate Dragonets ranged from hilarious (Ochre) and delightful (Fatespeaker) to entertainingly ridiculous caricatures of malice (the rest of them). Overall, this maybe wasn't as great as the books preceding it. It wasn't bad, not by any means! But a lot of it (not all of it!) felt more like the time in-between big events than something huge itself. Still, it was great to see Glory acting as Queen.

Wordplay, philosophical arguments, and crossing of the senses are among the themes that stand out from this book, and Rainn Wilson's portrayal of the story gives it great justice.",,A Childhood Favorite in a Wonderful Audiobook!!,"Rainn Wilson does so well with this story. His voice is smooth and steady throughout. He handles character changes easily. The surprise of his son's voice was ok, but also a bit odd because it was the only voice not done by Mr Wilson out of all the characters we meet. It felt out of place at first but then it seemed as if it would've been nice to have a boy's voice for Milo as well the entire time. As for the actual book, I am in love with the marriage of math and language used in a story to teach a lesson without beating the reader over the head with it. There are miniature lessons in the individual subjects and there is one overall message that is plainly revealed at the end of the book so that anyone reading or listening can understand why Milo needed this journey. I know the author wrote the book for a middle grades audience, but I recommend it for adults and younger children as well. I would recommend having a physical copy of the book for some to follow along, I know I loved seeing the wordplay written out (I'm a Word Nerd) and it helped me to see the numbers and goings on in Digitopolis. I have read the book many times and I still stop and solve the math problem every time because I find it fun and a great way to jog my memory about math rules. Teachers could could use this book in class to tie together multiple subjects into one unit. I can think of so many people who could find this book entertaining and some who would find it useful as well.",,,,,,,,

This is about a 12 year old girl, Sophie Foster, who has been able to read minds since she was five. One day she meets a boy at a museum whose thoughts she can’t hear, and he tells her they have been looking for her for twelve years. And he also happened to mention he’s an elf, and by the way—so is she. Sophie now needs to contend with who she always thought she was and who she will turn out to be, a whole new world, with not only a vast set of possibilities (Magic! Immortality!) but a set of strict rules too. As she tries to find her place in a new society and at a new school, where she really needs to work to keep her head above water, it slowly begins to look like there is even more mystery surrounding who she is than she initially thought. Also, there are these mysterious fires popping up threatening to kill humans, and nobody seems too bothered about stopping it from happening… I like Sophie’s character a lot. She is brave and tenacious and outspoken, all of the characters in here are very likeable, except when they’re clearly not supposed to. Most characters are a lot less whimsical than in Harry Poter, and like Harry Potter it’s very clear who are supposed to be the ‘good guys’ and the ‘bad guys’ and like Harry Potter the school setting is at times fun and a little ridiculous at times. It really like how the world and the magic is described, you get a very clear picture of how some of it works, and how it all looks. But there are two things I really didn’t like, and those were the insta-crushing on the cute boys, and how she went from being a moderately ok student in some subjects, to being a boss in all the things, without showing the reader how she made that progression I think this book sets up the series very well, and I think it will only get more interesting as the characters age with the story. I’m hoping things will get less black and white as this tale progresses, and the thought processes and conflicts get more intricate. Excited to continue the series. If you loved the pranks in Harry Potter (which I personally didn’t), a very driven main character, school rivalries, fun friendships, even if they are still a little superficial, another beautiful and lush world to discover, and a very colorful magic system, a compelling mystery, and adorable creatures to boot, I would recommend this to you! I think the narration for this was very good. It matched the stateliness of the older Elves, and all the characters; personalities shone through, but I think she made Sophie's character sound a little whinier at atimes. That could also be because she is really young in this book",22 people found this helpful,love!,"""can't wait to continue this series. so good. even got a good cry out of me lol",1 person found this helpful,Best book 10 out of 10 would read agin,I finished all of this book in 1 week!

I also enjoyed the narrator's take on the voices he was depicting. I know some didn't like Greypaw's lisp but I found it rather endearing and gave him personality.

So she became the star of a spin-off. The first book in this collection is different from the rest as it focuses on Beezus and the stress of having Ramona as a little sister and how it's okay to have feelings about it that feel wrong sometimes. The second book sees Ramona become the focus as she tries to learn how to handle kindergarten through several whimsical misadventures. We begin to appreciate Ramona as a flesh and blood child, setting up her development through the rest of the series. As the series continues through six more books, Ramona grows, taking her through third grade. Her family expands the house, she deals with troublesome kids at school and makes new friends, her parents have problems with employment and eventually welcome a new baby to the family. What makes these stories great is how Beverly Cleary writes them. She speaks from Ramona's train of thought, giving us her perspective without using a first person voice. She captures what kids worry about and how they think. Stockard Channing gives a great performance of the stories. I used to listen to many of these as a child on audio cassette from the library and much of my memories of them are linked to her reading. She doesn't make Ramona sound cute, she sounds like a kid (admittedly, an adult performing as one). This is great for kids and adults who still appreciate literature for kids. (And a bargain to get with an Audible credit!)",4 people found this helpful,Ramona is authentically herself,"""Such a pleasure to listen to this story. Stockard Channing is excellent.

Kate Winslet, an obviously great actress, brings this story to life. Without a hint of timidity she dives into each character, making them all feel truly unique without pulling you out of the story with unnecessary exageration. What did you like best about this story? The story is amazing, it is Annie for the 21st Century. Matilda does not (even if she were able) rely on any adult to get things done, and fully takes charge of her own destiny. There is not a single adult in this story that is not pitiful; yes, even the likable Ms Honey is rather pitiful as an adult. And, even though they are all pitiful the story does not get bogged down in fee-sorry-for-the-kids mantras. It is completely entertaining, from beginning to end. Which scene was your favorite? My favorite, is a small one where Violate and Matilda are told of the horrors in the school by an older student. That scene allows you to envision a thousand stories of the kids' endurance and rebellion at the school. If you were to make a film of this book, what would the tag line be? There is already one. The right of every kid to stand tall, no matter how small. But if I were going to make a tag line it might be something like; Matilda, when life gives you lemons, make champagne.",11 people found this helpful,A wonderful kid's story that adults love too!,,2 people found this helpful,Love it,All of it I give it a 10000 star rating If I could do it,2 people found this helpful,,,,,,,

If so, why? Though the ending was very surprising, there were some neat little bits that hint at what our heroes will be doing in the future. A well rounded conclusion and acceptable end to this world we've been entranced with all the way from Percy Jackson and the Lightening Thief to this final novel. I was pleased and the wait was well worth it. What did you like best about this story? I loved the use of the rotating narration from each character, and was surprised and elated to finally see things from Nico's and Reina's point of view. Have you listened to any of Nick Chamian’s other performances before? How does this one compare? I've noticed so many listeners have stated that Nick Chamian's performance got worse. I have to disagree. I thought he did much better than his previous works. He may not be as good as Joshua Swansen or Jesse Bernstein, but he has come into his own and I was much more pleased with him for the final work in Riordan's world of demigods. If you were to make a film of this book, what would the tag line be? Where most stories have a single hero, the Blood of the Olympus has nine. Any additional comments? Loved finally getting to look into Nico's point of view, the poor kid went through so much and learning about his.......huge secret in the last novel, I wanted to know how he felt about others and see if there was a way he could find acceptance. I loved seeing the Amazon's and the hunter's of Artemis one last time and how they worked together. I'm rather sad there is no other stories about this world of demigods.

I wanted my sons to experience it too, but they would never willing pick up a book, so this was the best option for our long commutes in the car. Such a wonderful and heartfelt story! Two thumbs up, a thousand times over!!",5 people found this helpful,A MASTERPIECE,"Mr. Rawls takes us back to a much simpler time, when life was a lot less complicated. He takes us to a place when “right” was right and “wrong” was wrong; where the deepest faith and treasured virtues of simple living made prayers and dreams come true. This book is much more than a story. Mr. Rawls delivers a compelling tale that chronicles a young boy’s rite of passage and the two Red Bone hounds who are an answer to prayer. The virtues of honesty, kindness to people, kindness to animals, teaching of responsibility and tenacious hard work are among the lessons of life that this author presents. Urban America might have trouble relating to the social innocence of an Ozark way of life and the thought of allowing an adolescent boy to run off into the mountain night pursuing his hounds on the trail of a raccoon. But that was a completely different age that Mr. Rawls is writing about. Again, he is writing about a much simpler time. Faith is at the core of this novel. Faith in God, faith in our fathers and even faith that our fathers must place in the hands of the next generation. There is an undertone, an almost unspoken veneration of the honor code of the outdoorsman; the hunter and the fisherman. This book even speaks to the faith that we should have in each other, especially in times of peril. It’s a classic tale that some will loathe for its simplicity, its innocence and the complete respect that Billy has for his parents and elders. There’s no hint of rebellion in the boy, and there is no dysfunction in his family. It’s simply a clean portrayal of what life could be if we were committed to honest, hard work and always trying to do the right thing. Billy’s strong-willed Grandpa, on the other hand, does sneak some corn liquor in on a hunting trip. This is a classic that every family should have with them on the long road trip to grandma’s house. But bring a box of tissues just in case. Someone in the car is bound to need them.",,,,,,,,

On the Edge of the Dark Sea of Darkness,Children's Audiobooks,Andrew Peterson,Andrew Peterson,The Wingfeather Saga,8,19,1/5/2021,20.7,2716,4.8,4.9,4.9,2431,192,49,24,20,2097,157,32,9,11,2067,170,40,15,9,Meaningful and entertaining but slowly paced,"I listened to this series on my own, and now I am sharing this with my eleven year old son and six year old daughter. I loved the narration. Peterson does a great job giving voice to his characters. He is one of the best narrators I have heard to date. The story itself is entertaining because it is intelligent as well as funny and written on a level which children and adults alike can understand and enjoy. The books are filled with Christian symbolism to which most people, even those who are not Christians, can relate. Self-sacrifice, love, family loyalty, truthfulness, forgiveness, and repentance are all themes of the series. There is more than one prodigal son in this series, all whose stores have very different shades of meaning and outcomes. Particularly meaningful is the method by which the monsters are made and then remade. There will be a lot for kids and parents to discuss with this series. Some of the more difficult parts of the books follow. There are monsters, distorted and overpowering, some exceedingly evil and powerful, and others misunderstood, regretful, despairing, or pitiful. The children and their families are in danger repeatedly and often escape death only narrowly. Many children are abused by adults and bullied by other children. War, thievery, murder, lying, betrayal, mental illness, depression, and fighting abound. Several loved characters die. The final death in the story is particularly difficult and a bit shocking. These elements may disturb some readers / listeners, especially younger ones for whom the book is aimed. That said, as the characters work through their problems in the fantasy world, they learn coping skills and wisdom which may help child listeners / readers deal with problems when they are mistreated, feel depression, or experience the death of loved ones. Some problems the characters experience belong solely to the fantasy world, and the manner in which they are solved belong solely to the fantasy world. These elements are where the spiritual symbolism broaden the meaning and beauty of the story. Perhaps the most memorable part of the books is the cast of characters. Most of Peterson's characters are complex, imperfect, and believable. Most are funny in some way. The pirate grandfather and several other characters, even the some of the scary creatures themselves, are very funny and entertaining. I think Peterson may have had input from some of his children when he thought up some sillier elements of his fantasy world. Cows are not particularly scary--let's give them rows of teeth and make them eat people. Let's make candles out of snot. Let's make a drawing of a character, each of us taking one body section, head, torso/arms, legs/feet, but not show each other our part until it is all done. Now this monster has the head of a bear, the arms of an octopus, and the tail of a monkey! The greatest difficulty I had with the story was the pace of the writing itself. Peterson's writing takes a LONG time to set the stage for each scene. Character's feelings are discussed, what they see, what they remember, etc., etc. until the story becomes quite tedious and somewhat repetitive. Sometimes the characters act in ways which seem unrealistic given the situations in which they find themselves which also adds to the tension and length of the story unnecessarily (Would mom REALLY say it was too dangerous for them to walk along a ledge when they were already being chased by monsters?). I actually left the room in which I was listening to the story and came back five minutes later with one character still walking down a staircase of a three story house towards danger. Did we really have to hear what everyone else in the person's life was doing right then? If I had been reading the story myself, I would probably had skimmed these parts and moved on with story at a faster pace than listening to the narration allowed. Sometimes I wonder if writers get paid by the word because this is a problem I have seen with other books including the Harry Potter series (especially the final book). My six year old daughter had another perspective, though. When I was complaining aloud that Peterson should move along a little faster, she yelled, Oh Mom, just enjoy the story for what it is! Haha, out of the mouth of babes...",10 people found this helpful,Awesome.,"""Great awesome amazing. Great family book. I have listened to it one time and I wanna listen to the other books.

The book was more of a review for me as much of the subject matter has been discussed on his podcast StarTalk, which I've been a fan of for a number of years. Still, it never gets old listening to Neil talk about the cosmos. He is an excellent communicator and has a knack for explaining the complex concepts of astrophysics so that even those of us without science degrees can appreciate and understand them. If you liked this book and have an extra hour a week, I highly recommend Neil's StarTalk podcast. The podcast is co-hosted by a comedian and Neil usually has an interesting guest and takes questions submitted by listeners. Guests range from astronauts to fellow scientists to celebrities who are interested in science. The comedian hosts are usually either Leighann Lord, Chuck Nice, Maeve Higgins, or Eugene Mirman. They keep the show's tone light and funny. If you liked this book and have twelve hours to kill, I highly recommend Neil's 2014 TV series Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey, which was a follow-up to Carl Sagan's Cosmos TV series. Must-see TV for science geeks.",6 people found this helpful,Exactly what the title says,"""A perfect primer for the unfamiliar with the Cosmos and all its complexity, wrapped and packaged in familiar terms, analogies and stories that ease our understanding of the universe.

Also, since my only prior experience with this series was the movies, it was nice to see a great deal more fleshing out of what is happening as well as getting inside the mind of Harry. There is something here for those who, like me, have only seen the film (as is usually the case with books turned to movies). If, for some reason, you still have not given this a shot, I say do so.

The last couple of chapters are basically his back of the napkin calculations of where the money went and what happened, so why not wait to hear where it actually went? I don’t think he painted SBF as sympathetic, he comes off as a disheveled, disorganized, very smart nerd who is arrogantly self-assured.

For example, the author constantly proposes printing out articles and websites as an antidote to the many choices we have to store our data digitally. Really?

However, for those who can absorb and apply business information quickly, the make pretend story this book keeps bouncing back to about Sarah and her pie shop is trying too hard to be a novel and steals hours of your life. At least half of this book is told as a parable to offer an application example, which isn't a bad idea... Gerber is no Hemingway though and he's apparently unaware of this. In the very beginning when he starts describing the haze of flour in the air being struck my sunlight you know you're in for a long ride. He's a slow and methodical reader which doesn't help either.

I felt guilty listening to a book about eliminating hurry at 1.75x speed. As this is my normal listening speed, I didn't change it because listening at slower speeds really seems like a crawl for me. Having said that, this book really has been life-changing for me. There are so many points in the book where I stopped, thought about where I am in my life, and prayed how I could eliminate the hurry I feel in that part of my life. I've pared down my closet to 7 sets of clothes (I need to go ahead and pack the rest.) I've learned to spend more time with my family in a calm, slow, manner away from the television (we're still working on phones.) I appreciate John Mark Comer's honesty in the struggles he has faced in becoming a less hurry-oriented person and the great examples he gives from his mentors and Biblical examples. The importance of being with people in the moment is one of the greatest takeaways I have from this reading. I think my greatest lesson from this book is how important rest is to God for us. Jesus tells the Pharisees that the Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath. The Pharisees needed to hear the second part. We, in our 75 mph in a 65 mph zone, looking for every shortcut available, travel ball every weekend, lifehack mentality really need to remember that the Sabbath was made for our sake. This is a book I will listen to several times to see where my walk with the Lord measures up and to make sure I am not hurrying ahead of where he wants to walk with me. I recommend this to every Christian, but especially those of us who are part of the hurry-up society. Take your time. Slow down. Maybe even set the book speed to 1.5x instead of 1.75x.",,,,,,,,

Double thumbs up!",7 people found this helpful,Great Approach to Team Building,"This book is written as a fable about a high tech firm that is struggling to make head way in its market, and the key issue is that the leadership team does not function effectively as a team. Lencioni uses this fable approach because it makes it easier for the reader to identify with the characters, and thus, the learning sinks in more effectively. The approach certainly worked for me. As the story evolves, Lencioni reveals each of the five dysfunctions (absence of trust, fear of conflict, lack of commitment, avoidance of accountability, and inattention to results) and how this particular leadership team overcomes these dysfunctions. He emphasizes that creating functional teams is an on-going process and not a one shot deal and that the process isn't linear - there is often back sliding and then movement forward again. At the end of the book, he includes a guide for using the model which covers an overview of the five dysfunctions, details of how to overcome each dysfunction, and a discussion of how the five are integrated. He emphasizes that the model is simple in theory, but it is difficult in practice.",2 people found this helpful,,,,,,,

I generally find the self help genre weak and I expected this title to be one more christian based positive thinking book. There is a tiny bit of faith-based stuff in the afterward, but it strives to be any-god-will-do. Mostly it is detailed, ordered, steps to, over time, improve your effectiveness. The Seven Habits (plus the new eighth one) are: Be Pro-Active, Set Goals, Prioritize, Think Win-Win, Listen, Synergize, Maintain, & Inspire This list seems a bit trite, but the author takes care to build each concept upon another. It is more realistic than most self-help books and does not promise a quick fix, or riches, or power, it instead suggests an effective pattern for somewhat steady improvement. This system goes beyond having a open mindset to having an abundance mindset. This does not mean an abundance of stuff, but noticing that many situations are not zero-sum, and that win-win net-positive situations are often, if not almost always, possible. Of course doing all the things the author suggests is non-trivial, but they are generally good suggestions for making progress once you are committed to change. The writing and narration is quite clear, folksy, and pleasant, and far from the exuberance of some books in this genre. Some may find the folksiness a bit slow and boring, try speeding it up.

I started with the Audible version, and Gary’s engaging narration immediately pulled me in. His energy and passion are contagious, making the experience both educational and entertaining. What makes this audiobook truly special are the moments when Gary goes off script. His breakout comments, personal anecdotes, and additional insights are the true gems. These off-the-cuff remarks add layers of understanding and context that you won't find in the written text, making the Audible experience incredibly enriching. Gary frequently reminds listeners to get the physical book, and at first, I found this amusing. But I quickly realized how practical this advice is. Switching back and forth between Audible and the enhanced features can be a bit challenging, so having the hard copy is a game-changer. I ended up ordering the physical book, and it now sits on my office desk as a crucial resource. The insights in Day Trading Attention are invaluable. Gary emphasizes that social algorithms now prioritize interests over people, highlighting the importance of creating valuable, relevant content. His advice on mastering either short or long-form content has been particularly useful, helping me better engage with my audience. This book isn't just about social media; it covers a wide range of topics including influencer marketing, paid media advertising, and building a community around your brand. Gary’s strategies for leveraging modern attention channels have already had a significant impact on my approach to content creation and audience engagement. I’ve read the hard copy once and am gearing up for a second, more detailed read-through. This time, I plan to mark up the pages and treat it like a textbook, extracting every bit of wisdom it offers. If you’re serious about mastering the art and science of storytelling in today’s digital age, Day Trading Attention is essential. I highly recommend buying both the Audible and the physical book. They provide different experiences that complement each other perfectly. Listen to the audiobook for Gary's dynamic performance and those priceless off-script insights, then use the physical book as a textbook to deepen your understanding and apply the strategies effectively. You won’t regret it.",,Current state of the individualized business marketing,"""Gary never disappoints. His insights and transparency is so appreciated! Being a small business owner is hard enough.

There are some applications for specifically what I was looking for based on the title and the many glowing, life changing reviews.. But I was looking for a book to deal specifically with avoidance behaviors. That is addressed in this book, but this is more of a book for those who have experienced trauma (and yes, I know we all have to some extent), or have been wired in ways that set one up for self sabotage, mostly on a spectrum of medium to high self sabotage. The first half of the book, while I'm sure it will speak to many, did not speak all that much to me. I found myself agreeing with the first half of the book, but not feeling that these were necessarily the issues that I was struggling with. Still I believe that for those looking to redirect negative self talk, self doubt, trauma, etc., that the first half of the book would be not only applicable but probably just what they need to hear and unpack. The second half of the book went more into mindset, mindfulness, expectations and action steps, once you've worked on what may have gotten you in such a negative space to begin with. I'm happily married, running a successful 30 yr real estate business and pretty self actualized, self confident and positive most of the time. That said, the second half of the book was a good meditation on subconscious thoughts vs conscious thoughts, self evaluation and self redirecting, all in a broad sense. Good for anyone, anytime, including me. The book mentions, accurately I think, the quantum field, mind-body connectedness, habit rituals, and more. I found some real quotable gems in the second half that I found myself compelled to take notes on. Then I found myself wondering, who is the author? I found this book from a recommended book list (I forget from who). So I looked up the author, Brianna Wiest, expecting to find a 40 to 60 yr-old woman with a background in marriage and family therapy, or psychology of some sort. To my surprise, Brianna Wiest (if I'm not mistaken), was 28 when she published this book. An author of some acclaim but mostly a modern-day writer of non-fiction and poetry. Wise beyond her years is an understatement! But a well-adjusted, well-spoken and even thought provoking writer who just feels called to help people find happiness and a better life. Commendable! I typically listen to any worthwhile audio book 5 to 20 times if it hits home. Repetition is the mother of all learning, as they say. So I'm going to give this book more listens to digest what I think are thoughtful, caring and sound ideas and principles. If you struggle with PTSD, or any kind of self sabotage on a scale that is holding you back, I would recommend this book. The author is impressive for her wise-beyond-years outlook on how to do more, be more and find happiness. (Sorry for the long review. This book and the author just surprised me.)",24 people found this helpful,Phenomenal Book!,"""The delivery and practical application suggestions are awesome.

I rarely read a book more than once but I will likely read BOTH of these again. They contain truth and wisdom, eloquently and accessibly expressed. I am fortunate to have discovered them.",39 people found this helpful,Amazing,"""When it comes to spiritual literature, I like stories the best. For example, by sheer statistics, since ive listened to Way of the Peaceful Warrioer probably 50 times by now, it must be my favorite. Others include Dying to be Me and Proof of Heaven. Ayway, this book is a praticularly fascinating story. What I love about it is that Mr. Singer isn't sick, or dealing with any great adversity. He simply notices the little voice incessantly commenting on every little thing in his life. And so he decides to not let his life be controlled by it. This means that he will follow impulses, say yes to assignments, jobs and projects he 1) doesn't want to do 2) doesn't feel qualified to do 3) feels would be risky or foolish, including physically dangerous The journey this sets off was stunning to me. Incredible moving. It leads to fulfilling careers, a family, and a fantastic spiritual life. As I've thought more about the story, what stands out is the benevolence of the universe's assignments. When I speak about relaxing and not judging to my friends, they'll sometimes say things like well, if I were to answer every call and silly idea presented to me, I'd have nothing else to do shortly. But as Mickey's story shows, when you really trust your life to go the way it's supposed to go, i.e. let life guide you, rather than trying to control your life....when you do that, you're presented with wonderful, amazing, and delicious and thrilling experiences. My own life is the best proof I can give of this approach's worth: I found my best job while minding my own business, driving a cab. I met my current wife and mother of my three children, while minding my own business at a lunch buffet at a conference. I am done running my life. I am convinced Life does a much better job and so I leave it to Her. This book is a great way to remember why.

Chernow’s is by far the most detailed and documented. I have always enjoyed Chernow’s biographies even if they are very long. Chernow always presents a rich sensitive portrait of his topic, in this case, Ulysses S. Grant. The book is well written and meticulously researched. I was impressed how thoroughly he investigated the claims of Grant’s alcoholism. He pointed out what might have been true or false claims of his periodic drinking. Mostly the book is unbiased. The author covers the entire life of Grant with a more in-depth look at his military career and the Civil War. He reports on Grant’s mistakes as well as the accomplishments. Chernow documents how Grant helped the slaves during the Civil War and after as president. Grant wanted to see them educated and obtain the vote. Grant helped pushed through the 15 Amendment to the Constitution. Chernow paints a picture of Grant as an advocate for civil rights after the War. Chernow shows how Grant’s trust of people had always caused him problems particularly when he was president. The author reviews in detail the various scandals of Grant’s presidency. I found the section of Andrew Johnson’s presidency and his attempts at blocking reconstruction post-Civil War most interesting. I know I have read about this before, but I think it meant more to me now because of the current political turmoil. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and learned more about Grant and his time. The book is just over forty-eight hours or 1020 pages. Mark Bramhall does an excellent job narrating the book. Bramhall has won twelve Earphone Award.",6 people found this helpful,Riveting,"""The broad strokes of the high school rendition of civil war history are fleshed out with tantalizing detail. Many longtime truisms are overturned. The traditional dry, cardboard image of Grant is replaced with a human being: marvelous, flawed, remarkable and mysterious. Also, in the current era of racial tension and violence, it is enlightening to be reminded of the long, bitter and unfinished history of violence between those determined to oppress an underclass of color, and others committed to the necessity to heal the rift and celebrate a union of rich diversity.",2 people found this helpful,Great insight into Grant,Detailed treatment of Grant and his service to the nation.

The last couple of chapters are basically his back of the napkin calculations of where the money went and what happened, so why not wait to hear where it actually went? I don’t think he painted SBF as sympathetic, he comes off as a disheveled, disorganized, very smart nerd who is arrogantly self-assured.

Needless to say it was very challenging to listen to. There are a lot of characters in this book and the narrator reads all the characters in unique made-up voices, some really tough to stomach. i thought the main of this book was poor. The preachy, know it all ways of Sid, the older gentleman grew tiresome as the chapters progressed.

But then, since Mr. Gaiman and I are not the same person, I do not expect to be enthralled with all that interests him, so that was fine. I admire the breadth and depth of his life as a writer.

This book I have recommended to many people. If you are interested in true crime this is a must read.",67 people found this helpful,"Scary, dark horrific monster tale, with some flaws","""I'd never heard of the subject of this book (whose name I'd rather not further glorify). But clearly, he is one of the scariest and most evil people who's ever walked the earth. He doesn't fit the mold of what we've been told of most psychopaths or serial killers (a doting father who was concerned about the effects of his crimes on his daughter?). Truly chilling, and estimates of his victims are probably significantly understated (he said he was active for 14 years, almost nonstop, but a mere 11 victims? Seems unlikely). Honestly the kind of book that makes you want to buy an alarm system for your home. It also teaches you that compliance with violent criminals is a VERY questionable tactic. NEVER get in a car. Better to be shot running away than dragged off to God knows what! Fight, run, and yell! (and hopefully shoot or stab if you are armed). Some flaws in the book. The narrator is insufferable with her cartoonish male voice. Considering that most of the figures in the book are male, and so much of the book is from actual transcripts, a male reader would have been more appropriate. But this female reader affected the same dumb male voice that almost seemed satirical and anti-male. It was a distraction. We are PAYING for this reading, so freaking do it well! Also, it was just kind of weird how the book was sourced. I know it was unavoidable, but unlike some other true crime, this was mostly leaked and on background source material, with a definite point of view and axes to grind. I realize that since the investigating agencies were all pretty much non responsive, and you had detectives that couldn't be quoted in the first person (except for interview transcripts) for legal or career reasons, the author was limited in her approach. The transcripts were an interesting perspective; if only they read with a real male voices instead of the same dumb female male impersonator voice! A nitpick, I could tell the author was a big city, probably liberal girl who'd never been around a gun or a firearms enthusiast or hunter in her life. She made it sound like the fact that the subject of the book was a gun enthusiast and hunter or someone who raised and killed his own livestock somehow selected him for being a serial killer, when 99.99% of gun owners and hunters and farmers are decent law abiding people. I'd imagine the average southern or rural reader will be rolling their eyes at some of the breathless implications Callahan makes about guns and hunting (I'm not a hunter, grew up in a big city, but even I laughed at this). Also her comments about Black Talon cartridges was a real howler. They're just hollow points, not cop killer or mass shooter bullets.",53 people found this helpful,I live in Anchorage....,"Great work by author. I only got this book because I lived it and became emotionally invested in Samantha's disappearance as did thousands of people all across Alaska. More information than was ever shared in local news. Almost more than i could bear to know. These coffee kiosks are easy targets for robbery or worse. A Soft target for the sick actions by the monster in this book. I won't say his name. Its difficult to imagine that this monster could be so normal, love his daughter, blend in and be a part of our community. True crime fans will appreciate this book. It was not anything I would normally listen to if not for the fact it involved my community and a girl who could have been anyone's daughter. This monster might still be in action if he had not made the mistake of taking this beautiful girl from the Anchorage community. She became everyone's daughter and the community was out in force like nothing I've seen before. . She was not forgotten, the huge outpouring of community awareness and surrort brought national attention to Samantha's disappearance. Started by her Dad's actions, and (family friends) spread through all of Alaska, successfully putting the monster in the national spotlight. Even though we didn't know who he was yet. This spread of information was rapid and grassroots. This was one time he was not able to slink off and hide his deeds. This author brought to light the failings of our local police investigators, the ego driven prosecutor, (Feldis) who stopped the efforts of the trained FBI interrogators from getting more information from the monster in custody. The Anchorage correctional center's failings in their responsibility for the monster in their care were numerous. That he was able tho kill himself is inexcusable and suspicious. The efforts made by Samantha's Dad and the community i believe to be the single most important factor in finding the monster. Samantha's father, friends and community did more, (in less time and resources) than the trained professionals did. Did more to put the community in action to help look for Samantha in the first hours after she went missing. Anchorage and all AK, took this to heart and Samantha became everyone's daughter. The author accurately portrayed the scrutiny and suspicions local law enforcement focused on Samantha's dad, boyfriend and close friends. That didn't deter her Dad and others from mounting a quick massive campaign to locate Anchorage's daughter despite the hell they were going though. They had boots on the ground efforts in searching the next day . I understand in these cases it's usually a person known to victim. It was so sad that the victim's family were also victimized. In my heart, this story will always be about the loss of Samantha, not the sick animal who took this daughter of Anchorage. I also want acknowledge and offer condolences to all of the other communities, victims and families the monster destroyed all over the country.",3 people found this helpful,,,,,,,

Kacie speaks with bold honesty and brave openness about her specific journey, all the ups and downs.

I don’t know if some Americans choose to live quite happy lives living in their rural towns or not traveling globally even if they could. Let me be clear—By no means was Kacie at all judging others or bashing her home country. She was just speaking her mind unapologetically & I love she finally (as you will hear) felt free to do so. Simply stated, listening to her book, it’s clear she loves many things about Italy far better than she does about the US (healthcare, slower pace) and that’s fantastic.

Isaacson's holds nothing back in describing both the genius and the jerk that was Steve Jobs. Overall, despite the brutal honesty regarding Jobs' MANY quirks, I think the book was favorable to Jobs. I came out of it admiring him as a visionary, but also thankful that I never had to work for him. Steve Jobs is our generation's Walt Disney: a brilliant innovator who beautifully blended art and technology while building some of the most enduring and iconic companies in human history. Other parallels to Disney: they both had complete control over their companies' direction; they were both highly visible spokesmen (even icons) for both the company and the brand; they both left behind a changed world (Disney with animation and theme parks, Jobs with the iPod/iPad/iPhone/Pixar); they were both astute businessmen in addition to being visionaries; both were pioneers in revolutionizing animation in feature films; and of course, sadly, both died too young of cancer. I've also enjoyed Disney biographies, particularly the ones, like this bio, which took an honest look at the flaws as well as the genius. I am not a huge Apple fan but I loved this book, and I love Steve Jobs; not because of who he was but for what he did. His greatest achievements -- iPod, iPad, iPhone, and Pixar -- were all revolutionary inventions, literally creating something new out of nothing. What would be the state of portable consumer devices today without Jobs? Would we still be using clunky flip phones with atrocious software? Would we have elegant graphical interfaces on our computers or devices? And what about family films? Would we be taking our kids to see abysmal Disney movies like Treasure Planet, rather than beautiful, inspired, emotional epics like the Toy Story trilogy and Finding Nemo? Even for those of us who aren't Apple people can thank Jobs' vision for pushing our culture in the direction of beauty and quality. This book highlights Jobs' vital role in all these revolutions. Particularly compelling are how Jobs was able to conquer both the music studios AND Eisner-led Disney in the span of a few short years. The details of those conquests are priceless, and this audiobook is worth it for those two tales alone. I also liked the details of his relationship to Bill Gates, and how it evolved through the years (hint: it was not as contentious as I'd always believed). But there is also much more. I found myself thinking what a jerk one second, and what a genious the next -- and then quickly back to what a jerk again. He is a study in extremes. I came into this book not knowing WHAT I'd think of Jobs in the end given some of the shocking excerpts in the press. I thought it was a good possibility that I'd hate the guy. But Isaacson effectively shows the humanity behind the insanity, and by the end, I can honestly say I genuinely liked him. I was even a little choked up by his cancer plight. It's so sad that the pre-eminent visionary of our time was taken from us in his prime -- not unlike Walt Disney was taken from us almost 50 years ago. So I guess in the end, Steve's impeccable taste served him well. In choosing Isaacson and giving him open access to his past, Jobs succeeded in putting out one last perfect product: a lasting image of himself that perfectly demonstrated his humanity, his deep flaws, and his enduring genius. I think he would have loved the result, and I did too. Dylan Baker's narration is excellent. Baker has a little sarcastic twang that I think is perfect for this man, and for this material. Wise choice.",101 people found this helpful,"Masterful, honest, and insane","""I love Apple so by default I love Jobs. I say this as a disclaimer but also because after reading this book it is my honest opinion that Steve Jobs was probably insane but that makes him no different that most people of amazing genius. You will find in this book a great bio of a man you will find complex and strange and after finishing you will respect him, but I am not sure if you like him or even want him in your life, just his products.",11 people found this helpful,Great book and awesome listening experience,This is my first audiobook.

Ms. Thorton Plymale and her siblings endured horrific trauma after trauma. They were failed time and again by their mother, who was trapped in her own prison of unresolved childhood trauma, and by the foster-care system. From free-spirited hippie culture, to a foster home that was beautiful on the surface, but pure evil behind closed doors, to a bus by the beach that was its own fairytale-like haven upon entering, I was invested in this story. The glimpse into the author's interior design business and process, was a wonderful surprise which I thoroughly enjoyed. I appreciated Stephanie's honesty about the struggles in her marriage, and with perfectionism, which is anxiety's high-achieving mask. For anyone who has a complicated relationship with their mother, or a family plagued with substance abuse, trauma, and mental illness, this book is for you. If you simply enjoy stories of survival, grit, resilience and forgiveness, this story is for you as well. I highly recommend listening to this book, but please take care. There are stories of child abuse and neglect throughout the book, that will be difficult to hear. As an added bonus, Mozhan Marno's beautiful narration added to the immersive experience of the audio book. She was the perfect choice for this story.",,,,,,,,

She deftly wove together her own experiences--what brought her to seek therapy and her experiences with a skilled therapist--and detailed narratives about a few of her own patients. Parts were laugh-out-loud funny, while I was also brought to tears several times (and even once in any book is fairly rare for me). The level of empathy in describing the patients makes it almost impossible not to also empathize, and the psychological insights about both herself and her patients provide enough food for thought to make a re-listen worthwhile for that reason alone. The narration was pitch-perfect for storytelling and dialogue, and always with the right emotional resonance. I actually checked several times that it wasn't read by the author because the tone was so absolutely perfectly that of a therapist speaking empathetically to a patient. 5+ stars, will totally recommend to my therapist! :)",6 people found this helpful,I've never finished a WHOLE book.,"I don't like to read because I lose focus fast and find myself having to reread pages way too often.

He presents his fluid and witty style clearly and with great pacing. You can tell how much effort he put into this book, and the listener is rewarded with a great variety of information. I enjoyed hearing the insider secrets about what to order when, what kinds of utensils and cookware are actually worth having, etc., but far more interesting were the stories of Anthony working behind the scenes at many restaurants in many cities. One word of advice: this book is gritty in the sense that he pulls no punches in his description of the restaurant industry and those who make it up.

If you google it, it’s still there in Oklahoma but is in disrepair.",69 people found this helpful,Cultural Horrors in the North American Indian Wars,"Empire of the Summer Moon, researched and written by S. C. Gwynne, and narrated by David Drummon. This is the story of the most vicious of all the Indian wars fought on the North American continent; the fight between the Comanche nation, first with the Spanish in New Mexico, then the Texans (and the famous Texas Rangers), and finally, the United State of America. This is the story of the war and the required destruction of the Comanche nation. Any Indian nation story having to do with the destruction of the North American Indian peoples is going to be measured in the shadow of the seminal, Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee. Bury My Heart explains how the indigenous nations of North America came to realize the white migrants to their lands were far too numerous to withstand. So, as nations, entered into treaties to hopefully provide the opportunity to live in peace and preserve traditional life. Truthfully, in Summer Moon, we learn no Indian was ever going to abide by a paper agreement in any case; documents meant nothing to him/her. Also, notwithstanding the written commitments, the migrating white Americans treated the original natives as being less than human, and therefore any obligation to a savage does not require fidelity. As such, Bury My Heart and Summer Moon are filled with holocaustic undertakings; by both the white settlers against the Indians and the Indian nations against the white settlers. The debauchery, hatefulness and vehemence that is explained in Bury My Heart is fathomless. Empire of the Summer Moon is about one of those Indian nations, the Comanche. Prepare yourself for a stunning realization; the ledger of atrocities falls more heavily upon the Comanche. Summer Moon is about common human wickedness. In Summer Moon, S. C. Gwynne, instructs us in the very evil content of the American Indian’s nature. If Gwynne is to be believed, we come to learn of the disrespect most Indian nations, and especially the Comanche had for other humans who came to them, through theft, trade, or outright war. In fact, the Comanche’s, and other Indian nations, according to the story, have a cultural bias to be horrific to their adversaries. That is not racism. That is just an explanation of the natives' learned cultural values. The Comanche, were merchants, but included in their mode of commerce, was the acceptability of not only fair trading but duplicity, and stealing wealth from others was also very acceptable. Yet it gets worse because in that practice of taking what you can if what was taken was another human being, it was their value that torturing the captive males to death and raped, pillaged and enslavement of the taken woman were proper acts. Any children were selectively treated like the defeated men or the captured woman. No assurances which way the matter may come down for the infants. According to Summer Moon, the Comanche were not trying to be impure, it was just their cultural origins that they followed. The Comanche’s were, for our purposes, the Mongolian hordes of Asia between 1206 and 1368. They had the same physical features, a similar societal milieu and a fierceness for fighting from mobile ponies as did the Mongols; and their nation spread as did the Mongols, through war and causing catastrophe on others. The genius of each society was their ability to learn war from a horse was strategically more potent in open plains warfare than relying on infantry. It is anguish to read the horrors one must learn to study to understand the history told here; but If it is mankind you wish to understand, this book is a step in the right direction for cataloging the nature of our species as horrific. As harsh as its contents may be, it is told wonderfully well, as its facts and stories are an organized compilation of data that delineates the people’s origin, development, wars, tactics, and demise. Very fact-intensive, but told in short episodes focusing on individuals and their part in the overall history. Oh yes, and the story has a wonderful flip in characters at the end. The book has a surprise ending. I have always admired our native American heritage. This book though, was a drastic realization the American Indian, is no better than then we, and we are no better than them. In effect, we still have the horror of our lack of compassion for others to overcome. Can we?",5 people found this helpful,,,,,,,

I am one of those people that only reviews items when I am truly blown away so let’s just dive on in. After reading this book I have got to say it is a compelling testament to Gabbard’s authentic dedication to serving her country. From beginning to end she speaks with a passionate narrative that delves into her journey from soldier to stateswoman, offering readers a glimpse into the inner workings of her mind and motivations. Her writing is driven by a deep sense of duty and a desire to make a meaningful impact on the world. She challenges readers to reconsider their perspectives on her and the broader political landscape. The book serves as a catalyst for introspection, prompting readers to question their own desires to become involved in the future of our country. Gabbard's sincerity shines through every page, leaving a lasting impression on those who seek a deeper understanding of her character and convictions. Whether you agree with her viewpoints or not, this book is an enlightening read that fosters empathy and encourages critical thinking. Gabbard's fearless approach to addressing controversial issues will undoubtedly leave readers inspired to engage more actively in the political discourse. In a world where authenticity is often elusive, Gabbard's unwavering commitment to her principles sets a powerful example for aspiring leaders everywhere. For Love of Country is not just a book; it's a call to action, challenging readers to become agents of positive change in their communities and beyond. I hope every single one of you that reads this book is struck with the same conviction I was. I’ve found the political spectrum to be very off putting in the recent past simply because of the totality of the landscape. To read this and get a deeper glimpse in to Gabbard’s foundation, why she is fighting her fight, and her vision of Americas future was simply outstanding. She speaks from the heart and it’s evident in every single page. The level of authenticity, vulnerability, and blunt force honesty is beyond refreshing and motivating.

He’s a blue collar worker’s billionaire, which is to say, everyday people like Musk. The story is mostly favorable, which causes it to come off like Musk had commissioned Isaacson to write it. That being said, Isaacson can’t help but let his political positions when documenting Musk’s occasional interaction with political matters. At these junctures, Isaacson goes into limousine liberal autopilot and portrays Musk as a conspiracy theorist, instead of the libertarian that he is. As a result, the unavoidable failure is Isaacson’s inability to check his political ideology at the door. This is the single greatest criticism of this biography.

His book is a grand slam. A masterpiece of engaging human stories and insights. There is Hollywood behind-the-scenes lore (the Shakespeare in Love chapter involving Julia Roberts and Harvey Weinstein is a particular standout). There is poignancy about the state of industry and its movement away from movies that matter, the very movies that propelled me to enter film school.

It kept my interest. The suspense in each chapter kept me on edge. couldn't wait to hear the next chapter.,,It’s good but not great,"""I’m strangely obsessed with the original audiobook, like listened to it 7+ times atleast obsessed. This is good. But some of the voices don’t seem right to me. But I do like the variation. I’ve listened to other audiobooks that are described as graphic, including sounds and such to bring the story alive, but this one for me… I don’t know. There was subtle piano music in the background almost the entire time unless it’s a cell phone buzzing or footsteps. Plus the occasional fight scene or romantic scene. I don’t regret listening to it, but I don’t think I’ll repeat this one like I repeated the original.",,Something is missing.,"This was my first listen (and read) to the book series. And this dramatized adaption is either dropping parts of the story or the story is lacking. ***spoilers*** Examples: story is about Grace who is forced to attend a High School that her Uncle is the headmaster of after her parents were killed in a car accident. Grace comes to learn that this is a special school and students are vampires, dragons, wolf shapeshifters, and witches. Grace ends up liking Jackson, a vampire prince. She learns that he’s unusual because he was ‘born’ not made. At the end of this adaptation, we get a repeat of some earlier scenes in Jackson’s voice. At this point he tells us he’s 100 years old. Uhh? A 100 year old high schooler? Grace’s cousin repeats that most of the kids have known each other since 5th grade, which is why the cliques are so well defined (Grace didn’t originally know it’s a school for special kids). In Jackson’s voice we also learn that his brother, Hudson, found his mate 5 years ago, and we know that his brothers mate, Leah, is in the same grade as Jackson. So mated as an 8th grader who is 95 years old? How does this world work? Grace also made an issue of “it’ll be weird if he’s very old” and that weirdness went away because she learned Jackson was born. Also, we know that Jackson wanted grace far from the school, we know that he told Grace’s uncle that it wasn’t safe for her. We just have no idea why Jackson thought this, at the end, in his voice, we hear all this. At this point we also know that he suspects ‘something’ is happening with the shifters and dragons but no one is talking. Minutes into meeting Grace he realizes she’s his mate and but tries to warn her to leave the school. Why? This was all before he knew what anyone had planned. Also, another plot hole… Grace who’s portrayed as this intelligent junior in High School who is super inquisitive… she just accepts what Leah told her with no questions? I.e. Grace’s parents were killed by Leah in an attempt to bring Grace to this school because somehow Leah knew Grace was mates to Jackson. And it’s worth noting Grace has never met any of these people, and hadn’t even seen her cousin since they were 5 years old. Grace learns all this at a very harrowing point to the story, and there’s plenty of pages left, but Grace never questions why Leah singled her out. Why Leah killed her parents. How Leah knew Grace was Jackson’s mate. Either the author had sloppy writing/editing or the dramatized adaptation’s director had sloppy direction(/abridging).",,,,,,,,

I actively sought this book out which is rare for me because I'm not much of a reader. It was weird hearing an audiobook for the first time but knowing Bob's voice and mannerisms really helped to get into it faster. I listened to this book every chance I got and man... if you like, as Bob put it (a LOT I noticed), fringe comedy and showbiz stuff this is a great book. Bob does a great job at mixing more personal stories and experiences with deep dives into his many projects. He seems very keen on giving credit where it's due and shouts out most of his collaborators, young and old, throughout the book and I liked that. (Again, if you're a *sigh*... comedy nerd, these stories are gold.) I have been following Bob into his more dramatic stuff up until recently and I enjoyed hearing about his experiences through those times of his life as well. Hearing of the period between (approximately) Mr Show and Breaking Bad provided me with a ton of Bob and Bob-adjacent projects and comedians I'd never heard of to check out. Bob himself was a pretty solid narrator. Again, first Audiobook so I have no real benchmark. I'd say about a little more than half of the time you can tell he's reading from a book, if you know what I mean, but the rest of the time his inflections and characterisations really shine through. Regardless of HOW it was read, enthusiasm was apparent in his voice throughout the book. He seemed happy to be doing it. He seems VERY proud of his work (he should be) but not at all in a cocky way. It actually made me really happy to hear him recite (verbatim) entire Mr Show sketches and share memories of chats with Del Close with such excitement in his voice. Like, I did that! I made that! I experienced that! Anyway, solid ending as well. I'm having one of those experiences where you've finished something but now you don't want to consume anything BUT that thing. So I may have to listen again. Definitely a book I can see myself coming back to several times. As long as it's on audio. My reading comprehension is ****",,Best book I’ve read in years,"""Very intriguing, educational, insightful and funny stories told by your favorite Bob whom you’ve come to love and respect. 5 stars all around!!!",,The best!,"So I could be biased, being a lifelong fan of Odenkirk, but this is the most enjoyable memoir I have ever had the pleasure of ingesting. Bob's memories of his life in comedy down to every detail, even the sad ones, are enthralling. As soon as I finished, I had to restart it. Highly recommended if you are a fan of his, or a fan of the comedy world in general.",,,,,,,,

Hearing it in his voice makes it so much more real and moving to me. His essays about his experiences of being a lapsed Muslim who enjoys the music of western culture in a post 9/11 particularly resonate with me as someone who grew up very religious and still find some comfort in it despite not being religious at all as an adult who also enjoys popular music.

I am deducting one star because I found a couple of instances of falsehoods that have been repeated from previous books, which have subsequently been debunked. These do not impact the overall story or book as a whole but bothered me enough to knock it slightly for poor fact-checking. For example, it repeats an often-claimed story that Mick Jagger propositioned infamous groupie Pamela Des Barres for a threesome with Michelle Phillips at the Stones hotel post-Altamont on the night of the show. Des Barres and Phillips have stated in interviews that this didn't happen but it has been a gossip rumor item in circulation for over 20 years. There is also a questionable item in the book pertaining to one of the Maysles Brothers being assaulted by a hell's angel in a dispute over the film Gimme Shelter. The book takes the hells angels version of events as gospel, omitting a very different version of what happened as told by the Maysles Brothers in the commentary track of the DVD. I personally find the Maysles version far more believable and question why both sides were not presented. Overall though, a very good although ugly depiction of what happened that tragic day and a good history lesson in what not to do when it comes to crowd control.",,,,,,,,

The cast was fantastic, a perfect Audible performance. I was a little hesitant to download this since I had not read the book, as a previous reviewer recommended. I nevertheless enjoyed this immensely and felt that comprehension of the story was not a problem. The only thing I felt to be a slight distraction was the listing of characters and crew after each episode, which is a very minor criticism indeed. This is wonderful entertainment!",53 people found this helpful,This Cast Needs to Make This Movie NOW,"""I'm a huge Neverwhere fan - the kind that is always pining for any kind of hint or glimmer of the Seven Sisters (ONE DAY WE SHALL HAVE OUR SEQUEL) or film adaptation. This radioplay is nothing short of superb, and a must for Neverwhere fans. This cast brings London Below to life way better than any I could've fancasted. McAvoy makes Richard not only good and sweet and earnest, but someone you can't help but love. Dormer is the perfect Door to this bizarre land. Harewood and Okonedo lend delicious edges to the Marquis de Carabas and Hunter. Chirstopher Lee's hysterical and a little sad as the Earl. Head is wicked, terrifying fun as Mr. Croup. Cumberbatch is, of course, awesome as Islington. I could listen to it over and over again. If you are a Neverwhere fan, you need this adaptation.

It was so good that I even took notes. The little stories provided to drive a theme home were great. I learned so much about Charlemagne that I didn't know before. I admit I am a little biased due to being a fan of his work on the Breakfast Club and Brilliant Idiots but as a fan I can say he practices what he preaches in this book. I connected a lot with certain things like the toy he believed was alive. I had a similar experience with that as well. The only negative thing I would say would be sometimes if felt like we got off track when telling the stories with the name dropping and different asides. It was cool via audiobook because it felt more like a convo but not sure how it would be in actual print!! Great start to your writing career!! Will keep a look out from much more!!,15 people found this helpful,Another Success Story. Valuable insight. Hilarious,"""As someone who faced even greater challenges growing up, I can bear witness this man is speaking the truth about overcoming obstacles towards known goals. When there is little or no support on the outside, you will go deep inside yourself and find things there you might not have otherwise known. Skills talents and identities. Gifts and tools. The author is an asset to mankind and the higher powers. Perhaps they channel through him. That said, he says he reads and pushes himself out of comfort zones. I hope he reads some books on the civil war. Less than 1% of the population in this country were slave owners. Yet more than 5% of my ancestors were wiped out during the civil war, fighting against slavery. Although that doesn't fit into anyone's narrative these days. It is still a good thing to know. That said, he is witty, very bright, flippant about forces against him, and has the gift of piercing through illusions and false perceptions. His stories offer sound advice that works. He really does have a musical voice, he just travels without the musicians and crowds. The Red Carpet will always roll out for him.",2 people found this helpful,REALEST book I have read in a while.,"I am partial to the writer because I tend to be blunt and abrasive like he is.

As usual Bill Bryson takes to his subject and drills down to the minutia and that is a good thing. His command of the language makes what is pretty much a dull subject, very interesting and entertaining. I agree with one reviewer that he should be a teacher as he makes each point interesting. I love the fact that he goes into detail on such things as food basics and the how & why things were done in the past. I regret that in about 6 short hours I'll have completed the book and will be waiting impatiently for the next.",2 people found this helpful,So many things to like here.,Bryson is one of my my favorites and this book did not dissapoint.

Hearing him update it all the way to 2017 is beyond words great, uplifting, hopeful and miraculous. Through all the sex, drugs, rock and roll and more drugs mayhem which led to his death twice, he showed how if you blame your childhood and parents, you'll never truly be happy. Once he stopped blaming, he stopped drugs, forgave all and transformed to a 100% life and habits. If you have any major struggles in life, listening to this book will help. Nikki as the main reader was spectacular as was voice over actor Ross Marquand. Both brought their all to voicing this and deserve major kudos. The only stumbling block to me was the voice over actor Sophie. While I'm not debating her talent, I do think she was miscast. Her voice grew annoying very quickly with all the grating qualities of the typical millineal and didn't have the sex appeal or gravitas needed to play Vanity/Denise Matthews and the many other women throughout Nikki's life that gave their own words to the book. Ross was able to transform his voice brilliantly, changing it up to the various people he inhabited. Sophie? Not even close. Otherwise, the book was perfection and I'll never forget it. Major respect to Nikki for transforming his life in every single way to one that is today healthy, vibrant, sane, loving, intellectual, loyal, drug free and an artistic genius.",1 person found this helpful,Shockingly honest in it’s beautiful brutality.,"This book touched me on so many levels.

This movie had such an impact on me, that after my daughter was born, and my husband had to travel, our weekly ritual was to order Domino's Pizza, and watch the Princess bride. Having such a close personal experience explained through Cary's audiobook was more than I could have wished for. His description of the real people involved in the making of the movie, was so enlightening. His telling of his experience, has brought new wonder and love towards the story. My appreciation grew through his eyes. If I could have one more wish, that would be to enter that theater, in 1987, with the desire to enjoy it rather than prove to my husband that going to the movies was a bad idea. The mere fact that I could not keep up that Sharad, just proves what a wonderful movie this really was. And I'd like to extend my thanks to Cary for opening my eyes to the making of this movie.

But some actors don't necessarily have a voice one would want to listen to. Mr. Lowe does. I usually listen to non-fiction books at double speed in order to pack in the information into a shorter period of time, but I listened to Mr. Lowe's story at regular speed because his voice is pleasant and his stories felt more performed than conveyed. The author is an amazing mimic and he parrots the voices of famous and not-so-famous people throughout the book. His stories are compelling and interesting and well worth a listen. It's also refreshing to read a story about a person ??? star or not ??? who has hit rock bottom and has gotten their butt kicked by life, only to get help and later find happiness and success.

One of the thing that jumps out at me is the difference between these genre films and today's big IP franchises. The genres allow for a lot of freedom to move around and change things up, which is missing in today's franchise system. And I really liked what he said about various incarnations of the Parker character, about Peckinpah's relationship to the studios and to genre films, about Steve McQueen.

How much you will like this book depends on your expectation. You will find it enjoyable and informative if you want something quick, light, and practical. On the other hand, although it gives the basic knowledge of the human brain, the discussion focuses more on behavior and psychology than biological or neurological.

I like Tina Fey generally, but I'm not a big fan of 30 Rock so I wasn't sure about the book. (for the record, I think the story lines are ridiculous, I think Alec Balwin is slightly annoying and I many of the 30 Rock jokes make me feel slightly uncomfortable.) I didn't think this book had any of the problems that 30 Rock has. Tina Fey seemed a bit neurotic but mostly just funny. I like her sarcastic take on most things (exception being: She seems pretty amazed by Alec Baldwin in a way I don't get). I was listening to the audiobook (earphones), in part, while my daughter napped. I laughed out loud several times and was actually worried that I'd wake her. Like I said, I particularly laughed at some of the times she talked about being a working mom and the pressures of being a mom (working or otherwise) in society today. This stuff always gets me, because I found the first 6 months of motherhood to be really hard and I like hearing from otherwise successful people who also had a hard time. Especially if they make it seem ridiculous that other people made you feel bad then. yeah. anyway, its pretty short. You should probably read it. the book generally had some pretty right-on moments that I haven't heard before. It wasn't heavily SNL, 30 Rock or even feminist (I wouldn't have minded the former or the latter). I kept feeling that she concisely poked at a bit of truth over and over again, in a way that was light, funny and real.",12 people found this helpful,The Fey Pride Parade,"""There is so much to love about this memoir, which anyone who's interested in what it's really like to work your way up through the ranks of television comedy should find very illuminating, but I have to give particular kudos to the book for two reasons: 1. As a gay reviewer, I found Fey's portrait of her many young gay friends figuring out their sexual identity's a nice combination of funny, sensitive and honest. The time in a gay person's life when he/she has either figured out their sexuality but not had sex or started experimenting sexually but is not sure what it means for their identity can be very confusing. The fact that Fey both manages to create portraits of these young people that both point out their foibles while acknowledging why they might be so en-foibled (yes, I made up that term) is like a successful high-wire act that incorporates a chair and a dog. 2. Apropos of Audible, this is DEFINITELY a book that's worth hearing in the audio format, even if you've read it already. Fey's intonations, imitations and inflections are not only super-enjoyable if you're a Tina Fey fan but also add a richness to the text that's characteristic of writers who have experience writing for performers. It is a testament to my parents that they never reacted negatively to the 4 year Pride parade that marched through their home. -Tina Fey, Bossypants",10 people found this helpful,"Read the book, and STILL LOVED the audiobook!",,6 people found this helpful,,,,,,,
